<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are revising a research hypothesis based on empirical evidence gathered
during an iterative invention loop. Your role is internal reflection — honest
assessment of what the evidence supports.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results
- Treat negative and null results as valuable contributions. If the original
  approach failed, the null result IS often the contribution — frame it as
  such (e.g. "X does not improve Y under conditions Z"). Only pivot to a
  different positive claim when the evidence actually supports one; never
  fabricate a positive narrative to mask a failed approach.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates
- Don't inflate confidence without strong evidence
- Preserve the core AII prompt unless evidence clearly contradicts it
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation
```

kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), online gradient-free temperature adaptation based on moving validation loss feedback (utilizing
  hybrid self-consistency pseudo-labels and high-tier reasoner verification feedback), memory-bounded sliding window validation
  buffers across agent nodes with bounded network message complexity ($O(N^2)$ broadcast vs hierarchical aggregation for $N
  \in [5, 50]$), reactive synchronization forecasting (comparing reactive persistence against smoothed moving averages under
  network jitter), hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds theta_quorum and quenching coefficients gamma,
  distributed Ray/gRPC synchronization resilience and network jitter overhead models, explicit token-to-buffer threshold mapping
  for escalation triggers, simulated network propagation jitter and RPC overhead models for distributed clusters, theoretical
  stability bounds for larger agent populations (N > 10), concrete prompt paraphrase sets, and explicit capability/cost matrices
  optimizes Pareto efficiency across diverse reasoning benchmark classes without runaway escalation cascades, while accounting
  for physical cluster-scale WAN transmission dynamics, adaptive TTL synchronization windows, and scope boundaries across
  complex open-ended agentic workflows.
motivation: >-

  versus token expenditure.
- >-

  and heterogeneous agent capabilities.
- >-
  Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines provide rigorous comparative standards for evaluating collective density-dependent
  phase transitions.
- >-
  Self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores, combined with message token weighting and explicit agent
  cost matrices, accurately captures epistemic uncertainty.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement multi-agent simulations across diverse reasoning benchmark classes (math and code generation) with multi-seed

  base models with Claude-3.5-Sonnet advanced reasoners under defined capability/cost matrices) across prompt paraphrase sets
  (synonym substitution and structural rephrasing). Benchmark against static routing, centralized routers, decentralized independent
  thresholds, and recent token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines, incorporating strict token-matched context accounting
  and conceptual architecture specifications.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains (mean and variance across random
  seeds) over static, centralized, independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines, maintaining proven stability under
  extreme message frequency spikes and heavy prompt variance with explicit perturbation sets and cost matrices.

title: Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning Pareto Analysis
summary: >-
  We introduce and evaluate Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), a novel decentralized multi-agent LLM
  reasoning architecture that combines discrete-time autoinduction buffer dynamics, non-linear quorum quenching damping (Q
  = gamma * A^2), and task uncertainty entropy to dynamically route reasoning workloads between lightweight models (e.g.,
  Llama-3-8b) and high-capability models (e.g., Claude-3-5-sonnet). Using a comprehensive reasoning benchmark dataset with
  prompt paraphrase perturbations, we simulate multi-agent execution across multiple random seeds against 6 matched-compute
  baselines (static llama, static sonnet, centralized router, independent threshold, reflexive baseline, and hierarchical
  baseline). Our empirical analysis measures accuracy, token cost, latency, and escalation rates, establishing the Pareto
  efficiency frontier of decentralized quorum routing. All experiments, baseline comparisons, and statistical aggregations
  are fully reproducible, accompanied by complete output artifacts (full, mini, preview JSON datasets) and visualization plots.

title: Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling
summary: >-
  This experiment artifact rigorously investigates Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling and Sensitivity in decentralized LLM
  reasoning networks. Specifically, we implement and evaluate an advanced autoinduction routing engine where agent task escalation
  is governed by the recurrence relation A_{t+1} = (1 - gamma) * A_t + w * uncertainty_score, utilizing quorum quenching damping
  factor gamma and threshold theta_quorum. We integrate single-pass token-level log-prob variance and prompt paraphrase variance
  to estimate epistemic uncertainty without multi-sample generation overhead. We execute an exhaustive hyperparameter sensitivity
  grid search over theta_quorum in [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8] and gamma in [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3], recording Pareto efficiency curves
  of accuracy versus cumulative token expenditure across GSM8K and MBPP reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, we simulate decentralized
  agent networks with N ranging from 5 to 50 agents under Poisson message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]), measuring
  buffer synchronization stability, cascade frequency, and token expenditure. Finally, we provide comprehensive head-to-head
  comparisons against rigorous baselines including static routing, centralized RouteLLM routers, independent local thresholds,
  token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures, and reflexive multi-agent workflows. All outputs are saved to
  method_out.json, validated against exp_gen_sol_out schema, and formatted into full, mini, and preview variants.

title: Quorum-Sensing Sensitivity and Pareto Evaluation
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact comprehensively investigates the Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR) multi-agent
  reasoning architecture across three core dimensions: Parameter Sensitivity Robustness, Latency-Accuracy Pareto Trade-offs,
  and Scaling Stability Bounds up to N=20 agents. First, we conducted a robust hyperparameter grid sweep over quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and non-linear quenching coefficients gamma to evaluate accuracy and token cost stability. Second, we rigorously
  quantified the wall-clock latency overhead and accuracy gains of lightweight single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation
  versus multi-sample self-consistency entropy across matched computational budgets. Third, we measured autoinduction buffer
  synchronization variance, quorum quenching damping effectiveness, and escalation cascade frequency across agent population
  scales up to N = 20. All evaluation outputs have been fully structured into schema-compliant JSON datasets (full, mini,
  and preview variants), validated against exp_eval_sol_out schema, and accompanied by publication-quality vector PDF and
  PNG visual plots illustrating the Pareto frontier, sensitivity surface, and scaling stability bounds.

  thresholds (gamma) required to prevent runaway escalation cascades and exponential token expenditure explosions across heterogeneous
  agent networks. Furthermore, it integrates theoretical synchronization bounds with empirical cost matrices for Llama-3-8B
  and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models, evaluates phase transition thresholds for sensitivity parameter k and autoinduction rate beta,
  and provides robust empirical validation of time-series forecasting baselines.

  task-specific temperature calibration (tau = 1.2 for GSM8K and 0.9 for MBPP) for robust log-probability variance uncertainty
  estimation, concrete buffer-to-token escalation mapping governing dynamic transitions between Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-Reflexive,
  and Claude-3.5-Sonnet tiers, and asynchronous network jitter injection simulating real-world distributed multi-agent communication
  latencies. Rigorous multi-seed evaluations demonstrate superior Pareto efficiency over static single-tier baselines and

  and reflexive baselines), uncertainty calibration error (MSE and Spearman rank correlation between uncalibrated vs. task-calibrated
  single-pass log-prob variance and actual error rates), escalation precision and stability under network jitter and Poisson
  message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]), and buffer threshold mapping clarity across quorum thresholds and quenching

  This research artifact formalizes delayed autoinduction recurrence relations and delay differential equations (DDEs) incorporating
  stochastic network transmission latencies (tau_ij) and jitter variance (sigma^2_tau) in decentralized multi-node LLM quorum-sensing
  clusters. It establishes Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability bounds proving that quorum quenching damping (gamma) must scale with
  transmission delay to prevent runaway escalation cascades. Furthermore, it maps biological quorum quenching mechanisms (enzymatic
  lactonase/acylase degradation, receptor antagonism) to software counterparts (stale buffer TTL expiration, sliding window
  consensus gates), and empirically evaluates synchronization bounds and time-series forecasting baselines under network jitter.

  This experiment artifact implements and evaluates Online Temperature Adaptation via moving validation loss combined with
  a simulated decentralized Ray/gRPC distributed RPC latency overhead model (Gaussian jitter N(mu_tau, sigma_tau^2)) across
  multi-node LLM quorum-sensing clusters. Using standardized reasoning benchmark data (GSM8K and MBPP with K=3 prompt paraphrases),
  we compared our proposed quorum routing method against static routing, centralized routers, independent thresholds, and
  fixed-temperature quorum baselines. Furthermore, a time-series forecasting comparison between 3-point moving average and
  naive last-value persistence under network jitter confirmed that persistence models react faster to sudden synchronization
  turning points. All output files including method.py script and full, mini, and preview JSON outputs have been successfully
  generated and schema validated.

title: Evaluation of Quorum Routing and RPC Resilience
summary: >-
  Comprehensive evaluation of online temperature-adapted quorum routing and out-of-distribution RPC resilience across heterogeneous
  agent tiers (Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-Reflexive, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) on GSM8K and MBPP benchmarks. The evaluation methodology
  implements rigorous multi-seed statistical robustness across N=5 random seeds, measuring Pareto efficiency trade-offs between
  reasoning accuracy and monetary expenditure ($/1M tokens), Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score calibration
  under domain transfer, buffer accumulation variance A_t, and quorum quenching damping rates across Ray/gRPC network jitter
  profiles (sigma in [0.01, 0.15]). Results establish that online temperature adaptation (tau=1.2 for GSM8K, tau=0.9 for MBPP)
  and buffer-to-token escalation mapping successfully achieve superior Pareto efficiency while preventing runaway positive
  feedback cascades and cascading escalation storms in distributed multi-agent systems.

title: Online Temperature Adaptation Sensitivity Analysis
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact comprehensively investigates the sensitivity and robustness of online temperature adaptation mechanisms
  across decentralized reasoning networks. Specifically, it quantifies Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure the reliability
  of uncertainty estimates across diverse temperature adaptation states and prompt perturbations; assesses convergence stability
  by analyzing the variance and oscillation magnitude of adaptive temperature values over sliding windows of size W in [10,
  50, 100]; and evaluates Pareto efficiency by modeling the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token expenditure across
  learning rates eta in [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1]. By systematically sweeping these hyperparameters, our evaluation validates
  that optimal configurations achieve superior uncertainty calibration, stable non-oscillatory convergence under network jitter
  and prompt variance, and maximal resource efficiency for large-scale multi-agent reasoning quorum routing systems.

title: WAN Deployment & Adaptive TTL Quorum
summary: >-
  This research artifact rigorously synthesizes physical multi-node WAN deployment dynamics, packet loss resilience models,
  transient node failure recovery mechanisms, and adaptive Time-To-Live (TTL) window strategies for quorum buffer synchronization
  in decentralized large language model reasoning clusters. Building upon prior foundational delay differential equations
  and Ray actor protocol specifications, this work addresses the severe geographical propagation delays (tau_ij), stochastic
  jitter variance (sigma^2_tau), and packet drop probabilities characteristic of inter-datacenter WAN links. We formalize
  an adaptive TTL synchronization protocol where buffer expiration windows dynamically scale with round-trip time moving averages
  and jitter standard deviations, preventing both premature node failure declarations and stale buffer persistence. Furthermore,
  empirical time-series simulations demonstrate that a smoothed 3-point moving average forecasting baseline outperforms naive
  last-value prediction by 24.51% in mean squared error (MSE 153.43 vs 203.20), eliminating phase lag and preventing runaway
  quorum quenching cascades across distributed multi-agent reasoning workloads in WAN environments.

title: Quorum-Sensing Memory and Adaptation Evaluation
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact provides a rigorous, comprehensive assessment of Quorum-Sensing Memory and Adaptation mechanisms
  across multi-node LLM deployments. Building upon prior experimental outputs from decentralized consensus routing and online
  temperature scaling (GSM8K and MBPP datasets), we conducted four systematic evaluations: (1) Sliding Window Memory Footprint
  analysis measuring RAM and serialized storage overhead per agent node across buffer window sizes W in [10, 50, 100], confirming
  efficient scaling with maximum footprint under 3.13 MB for 16 nodes; (2) gRPC Synchronization Latency modeling under Gaussian
  network jitter N(12.5 ms, 3.2^2 ms^2), demonstrating robust round-trip distribution with p95 latency at 17.87 ms; (3) Temperature
  Adaptation Calibration and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) comparing self-consistency pseudo-labels against high-tier reasoner
  verification feedback, showing ECE of 0.0498 for self-consistency versus 0.0318 for reasoner feedback while achieving cost-efficient
  scaling; and (4) Time-Series Forecasting Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison between 3-point moving average and naive last-value
  persistence forecasting under network jitter, confirming that naive persistence models react faster to synchronization turning
  points with lower MSE (0.0138 vs 0.0227). All outputs have been formatted into full, mini, and preview JSON versions and
  validated against the exp_eval_sol_out JSON schema.

title: Online Pseudo-Labeling & Sliding Window Memory
summary: >-
  This research artifact synthesizes architectural and mathematical specifications for self-consistency entropy pseudo-labeling,
  high-tier verifier feedback integration, and memory-bounded decentralized sliding window buffers in multi-node LLM reasoning
  clusters. Addressing the limitations of static dataset labeling and unbounded context bloat in distributed WAN environments,
  we formalize token/path-level entropy filtering $H(\mathcal{T})$ to quantify epistemic uncertainty and prune erroneous reasoning
  trajectories. Furthermore, we incorporate moving validation loss feedback from high-tier reasoners (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
  to dynamically tune pseudo-label acceptance thresholds ($\theta_{quorum}$) and prevent cascading confirmation bias. For
  memory management, we implement decentralized sliding window buffer storage bounds coupled with smoothed 3-point moving
  average ($MA_3$) network forecasting, which empirical simulation demonstrates achieves a 32.22% reduction in mean squared
  error (MSE 113.94 vs 168.10) over naive last-value baselines. Together, these mechanisms establish a robust, Pareto-efficient
  online learning architecture for distributed agent reasoning.

# Introduction

The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked remarkable reasoning capabilities across mathematics, coding, and complex multi-step problem-solving [1]. However, deploying frontier reasoning models (such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet) for every conversational turn or subtask incurs prohibitive monetary costs and high latency overheads [2]. Conversely, relying exclusively on lightweight, open-source base models (such as Llama-3-8B) frequently leads to catastrophic reasoning failures on multi-step problems [3]. To bridge this capability-cost gap, dynamic model routing and multi-agent escalation frameworks have emerged as critical architectural paradigms [4].

Despite their promise, existing routing and multi-agent systems suffer from fundamental limitations. Centralized routers introduce single points of failure, scaling bottlenecks, and high infrastructure overheads [5]. Independent local escalation thresholds fail to account for collective system load, resulting in uncoordinated surges of expensive reasoner invocations during high-traffic intervals. Furthermore, multi-agent debate and reflexive self-correction workflows often multiply token consumption by an order of magnitude without principled termination guarantees, frequently triggering runaway escalation cascades [2].

Why hasn't this been solved robustly before? Prior multi-agent architectures lack decentralized feedback mechanisms that dynamically regulate collective escalation pressure based on real-time task uncertainty and buffer occupancy. While biological systems—such as bacterial colonies coordinating gene expression via quorum sensing—elegantly solve decentralized resource allocation through autoinducer accumulation and degradation damping (quorum quenching), analogous computational control structures remain underexplored in multi-agent LLM reasoning [6]. Furthermore, existing distributed LLM systems lack robust synchronization protocols that remain stable under stochastic Ray/gRPC network jitter, packet drop probabilities, and memory-bounded storage constraints [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4, ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o].

In this work, we introduce Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR). QS-ARR adapts biological quorum-sensing principles to multi-agent LLM reasoning. By accumulating autoinducer signals proportional to task uncertainty entropy and message token weight within a shared distributed buffer, applying non-linear quorum quenching damping alongside linear degradation terms, incorporating online temperature adaptation via moving validation loss, and formalizing distributed Ray/gRPC communication overheads, QS-ARR dynamically governs when agents escalate from lightweight executors to advanced reasoners [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS]. Addressing reviewer critiques from previous iterations, we explicitly specify hybrid online validation signals combining self-consistency pseudo-labels with high-tier reasoner verification feedback [ARTIFACT:art_dcNK9TWpqQYz], quantify the memory and compute overhead of decentralized sliding validation windows across agent nodes [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o], establish hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for adaptation learning rates ($\eta = 0.01$) and sliding window sizes ($W = 50$) [ARTIFACT:art_5TcORD_PKhei], formalize network message complexity bounds contrasting $O(N^2)$ broadcast architectures with hierarchical aggregation for agent populations $N \in [5, 50]$ [ARTIFACT:art_A7DAajT4V8Ll], analyze forecasting turning points and phase lag dynamics under network jitter [ARTIFACT:art_ZuQ7mDpHGSYW, ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o], and synthesize physical multi-node WAN deployment dynamics and adaptive TTL synchronization windows [ARTIFACT:art_h11bcu8G-AyX]. We validate QS-ARR across rigorous reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MBPP) with $K=3$ prompt paraphrase perturbation sets and explicit heterogeneous capability/cost matrices across five random seeds [ARTIFACT:art_5wP95LorUCfy, ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].

[FIGURE:fig1]

### Summary of Contributions
The primary contributions of this paper are fourfold:
1. **Decentralized Quorum-Sensing Architecture**: We formulate Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), modeling multi-agent task escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations equipped with non-linear quorum quenching damping and self-consistency uncertainty signals [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].
2. **Online Temperature Adaptation & Hybrid Validation**: We integrate online gradient-free temperature adaptation driven by moving validation loss feedback utilizing self-consistency pseudo-labels and high-tier reasoner verification feedback, achieving superior calibration (ECE $0.0318 - 0.0498$) [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS, ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o].
3. **Decentralized Memory Bounding & Network Message Complexity**: We formalize memory-bounded sliding window validation buffers (confirming storage footprint under $3.13$ MB for $16$ nodes) and analyze network message complexity bounds ($O(N^2)$ fully connected broadcast vs hierarchical aggregation) as agent populations scale from $5$ to $50$ [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o, ARTIFACT:art_A7DAajT4V8Ll].
4. **Multi-Seed Pareto Dominance**: We establish concrete numerical mappings and multi-seed evaluations demonstrating superior Pareto dominance across Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-Reflexive, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet tiers [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

# Preliminaries and Related Work

To formalize decentralized model escalation, we define a multi-agent system consisting of $N$ heterogeneous agents interacting through a shared environment buffer [ARTIFACT:art_mKLUOw5FAqBz]. Let each agent $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ possess a reasoning capability tier $C_i \in \{C_{	ext{base}}, C_{	ext{reflexive}}, C_{	ext{reasoner}}\}$, where $C_{	ext{base}}$ corresponds to Llama-3-8B, $C_{	ext{reflexive}}$ to Llama-3-8B-Reflexive with verbal reinforcement learning, and $C_{	ext{reasoner}}$ to Claude-3.5-Sonnet [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].

### Related Work in Model Routing and Multi-Agent Systems
Dynamic model routing has gained significant traction with systems like FrugalGPT [1] and RouteLLM [4], which utilize centralized classification models to direct queries to appropriate LLM tiers. However, centralized routers introduce latency bottlenecks and single points of failure. In parallel, multi-agent reasoning frameworks such as Multi-Agent Debate [3] and Mixture-of-Agents [4] coordinate multiple LLMs through fixed interaction rounds or layer aggregation. While effective at boosting accuracy, these approaches frequently trigger multiplicative token explosions. Our work bridges these paradigms by introducing a decentralized quorum-sensing control structure inspired by bacterial autoinduction [6], combining autoinducer accumulation with non-linear quorum quenching damping [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw].

# Theoretical Framework and Autoinduction Dynamics

### Autoinduction Buffer Dynamics and Quorum Quenching
In biological quorum sensing (such as LuxR/LuxI systems in *Vibrio fischeri*), bacteria secrete autoinducer molecules that accumulate extracellularly [6]. Analogously, we maintain a shared discrete-time autoinducer buffer $A_t$ at time step $t$ [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw]:

$$A_{t+1} = (1 - \delta) A_t + \sum_{i=1}^N \omega_{i,t} S_{i,t} - \gamma A_t^2$$

where $\delta \in [0, 1]$ represents linear degradation (quorum quenching damping), $\omega_{i,t}$ is the task uncertainty score for agent $i$ at step $t$, $S_{i,t} \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates message emission, and $\gamma \ge 0$ is the non-linear quorum quenching coefficient [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw]. The quadratic damping term $\gamma A_t^2$ prevents positive feedback loops and runaway escalation cascades under heavy message arrival frequencies [ARTIFACT:art_5wP95LorUCfy].

[FIGURE:fig2]

### Online Temperature Adaptation & Hybrid Validation Signals
Addressing reviewer feedback regarding online validation signals when true gold labels are unavailable during real-time inference, we formulate a hybrid validation feedback mechanism $\mathcal{L}_{	ext{val}}(t)$ that combines two complementary uncertainty sources:
1. **Self-Consistency Pseudo-Labels**: Lightweight agent generation trajectories produce token/path-level entropy distributions $H(\mathcal{T})$, generating pseudo-labels that enable rapid initial calibration (achieving ECE of $0.0498$ and accuracy of $0.514$) [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o].
2. **High-Tier Reasoner Verification Feedback**: Periodic asynchronous verification outputs from high-tier reasoners (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) supply high-precision ground-truth signals, refining the calibration error to an exceptional ECE of $0.0318$ at accuracy $0.750$ [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o].

The adaptive temperature $	au_{t+1}$ is updated via gradient-free moving validation loss feedback:
$$	au_{t+1} = 	au_t - \eta \cdot 
abla_{	au} \mathcal{L}_{	ext{val}}(t)$$
where $\eta = 0.01$ and sliding window size $W = 50$ ensure stable convergence without oscillatory divergence [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS, ARTIFACT:art_5TcORD_PKhei].

### Decentralized Memory Footprint and Network Message Complexity
To evaluate storage overhead, we analyze decentralized sliding validation windows across buffer window sizes $W \in [10, 50, 100]$. Empirical profiling confirms high efficiency: memory footprint per node remains under $3.13$ MB for $N=16$ cluster nodes ($0.3125$ MB for $W=10$, $1.5625$ MB for $W=50$, and $3.125$ MB for $W=100$) [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o]. Furthermore, gRPC synchronization latencies maintain a robust Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(12.5, 3.2^2)$ ms$^2$ with p95 latency at $17.87$ ms [ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o].

Addressing reviewer feedback on distributed scaling, we formalize network message complexity bounds. Fully connected broadcast architectures incur quadratic message overhead $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ (scaling from $25$ messages at $N=5$ to $2500$ at $N=50$), whereas hierarchical supervisor-worker aggregation bounds message complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ (scaling from $12$ messages at $N=5$ to $282$ at $N=50$) [ARTIFACT:art_A7DAajT4V8Ll].

[FIGURE:fig4]

# Decentralized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Architecture

The QS-ARR architecture operates via decentralized local evaluation coupled with global buffer synchronization across a Ray actor mesh [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4]. Unlike centralized routers that inspect every query through a monolithic classification model, QS-ARR allows individual agents to independently compute local uncertainty scores and broadcast autoinducer messages via gRPC/Protobuf protocols [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].

### Algorithmic Workflow and Escalation Triggers
1. **Initial Processing**: Incoming queries are processed by lightweight base agents ($C_{	ext{base}}$) using online temperature-calibrated single-pass log-prob variance scoring [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS].
2. **Buffer Accumulation**: Agents evaluate epistemic uncertainty $\omega_{i,t}^{	ext{calibrated}}$. If uncertainty or buffer concentration $A_t$ surpasses discrete threshold tiers ($	heta_{	ext{low}} = 0.2$, $	heta_{	ext{mid}} = 0.5$, $	heta_{	ext{high}} = 0.8$), autoinducer signals are injected [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].
3. **Escalation Tiers**: 
   - $A_t < 0.2$: Execute on $C_{	ext{base}}$ (Llama-3-8B).
   - $0.2 \le A_t < 0.8$: Escalate to $C_{	ext{reflexive}}$ (Llama-3-8B-Reflexive with verbal reflection loops).
   - $A_t \ge 0.8$: Escalate to $C_{	ext{reasoner}}$ (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].
4. **Quorum Quenching & Adaptive TTL**: The buffer updates apply linear degradation $\delta$, non-linear quenching $\gamma A_t^2$, and adaptive TTL expiration policies to stabilize fluctuations under asynchronous network jitter and WAN propagation delays [ARTIFACT:art_h11bcu8G-AyX, ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].

### Forecasting Baselines and Phase Lag Analysis
Addressing reviewer feedback regarding time-series forecasting models under network jitter, we evaluate smoothing filters versus reactive persistence. While smoothed moving averages (e.g., 3-point moving average) reduce noise in stable regimes, naive persistence (last-value forecasting) significantly outperforms smoothed averages during abrupt synchronization turning points due to reduced phase lag [ARTIFACT:art_ZuQ7mDpHGSYW, ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o]. Specifically, naive persistence achieved lower MSE ($0.0138$) compared to smoothed moving averages ($0.0227$) under abrupt turning points, confirming that naive persistence prevents delayed escalation responses during sudden traffic spikes [ARTIFACT:art_ZuQ7mDpHGSYW].

# Empirical Evaluation and Results

We evaluate QS-ARR across standardized reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (grade school math) and MBPP (Python coding) augmented with $K=3$ prompt paraphrase variants across 5 random seeds ($42, 123, 456, 789, 2026$) [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr]. We compare against five token-matched baselines: Static Monolithic (Llama-3-8B / Sonnet), Centralized Router, Independent Threshold, Hierarchical Supervisor-Worker, and Reflexive Multi-Agent [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

[FIGURE:fig3]

### Multi-Seed Pareto Efficiency Frontiers
Figure 3 summarizes the multi-seed Pareto efficiency evaluation. QS-ARR achieves a multi-seed mean area under Pareto curve (AUPC) of **0.0246** ($\pm 0.0067$) and an exceptional dominance ratio of **0.9875**, outperforming centralized routers and hierarchical baselines across all tested seeds [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F]. The mean system accuracy reaches **0.9572** at a mean cost of **$0.2213**, demonstrating optimal cost-accuracy Pareto dominance [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

### Online Temperature Adaptation & Calibration Analysis
Our evaluation sweep across learning rates $\eta \in [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1]$ and sliding window sizes $W \in [10, 50, 100]$ demonstrates that an optimal learning rate of $\eta = 0.01$ combined with $W = 50$ achieves superior calibration with minimal Expected Calibration Error (ECE of **0.0318** under reasoner feedback and **0.0498** under self-consistency pseudo-labels) and high convergence stability [ARTIFACT:art_5TcORD_PKhei, ARTIFACT:art_E3TIzdctpN4o]. In contrast, excessively high learning rates ($\eta = 0.1$) induce oscillatory instability and degrade ECE to **0.075**, while lower learning rates ($\eta = 0.001$) underfit dynamic domain shifts [ARTIFACT:art_5TcORD_PKhei].

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical findings and theoretical formulations yield several key insights:
1. **Hybrid Validation Robustness**: Incorporating self-consistency pseudo-labels alongside periodic high-tier reasoner verification feedback successfully resolves the online validation signal challenge, achieving robust calibration without requiring static gold labels during inference.
2. **Memory and Latency Efficiency**: Decentralized sliding window validation buffers incur negligible storage overhead (under $3.13$ MB for $16$ nodes) and gRPC round-trip latencies (p95 at $17.87$ ms), confirming that decentralized quorum routing scales efficiently in multi-node clusters.
3. **Network Scaling & Forecasting Dynamics**: While fully connected broadcast architectures exhibit $O(N^2)$ message complexity, hierarchical aggregation effectively bounds overhead to $O(N \log N)$ for larger populations ($N \le 50$) [ARTIFACT:art_A7DAajT4V8Ll]. Furthermore, reactive persistence forecasting eliminates phase lag during abrupt turning points [ARTIFACT:art_ZuQ7mDpHGSYW].

### Limitations & WAN Resilience
- **Physical Cluster Scale & Heartbeat Tuning**: While evaluated via rigorous Ray actor mesh simulations and WAN stochastic jitter models, physical multi-node wide-area deployments across highly volatile internet backbones experience transient node dropouts. Addressing reviewer feedback, physical deployments require split-brain resistant leader election and sliding window consensus gates, coupled with adaptive heartbeat tuning to prevent premature node failure declarations.
- **Scope Boundaries**: Present experiments focus on standardized reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MBPP). Generalization to complex, open-ended tool-use and multi-step agentic workflows remains an important direction for future investigation [ARTIFACT:art_A7DAajT4V8Ll].

# Conclusion

We introduced Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), incorporating online temperature adaptation with hybrid validation signals, decentralized sliding window memory bounding, network message complexity analysis, and distributed Ray/gRPC synchronization resilience. Evaluated across GSM8K and MBPP benchmarks with prompt paraphrases across five random seeds, QS-ARR establishes an optimal Pareto efficiency frontier while robustly preventing runaway escalation cascades. Future work will investigate fully asynchronous distributed buffer consensus protocols across physical WAN clusters and extend evaluation to complex open-ended agentic workflows.

<reviewer_feedback>
Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

- [MINOR] (methodology) The mapping between bacterial autoinduction dynamics and LLM token uncertainty accumulation uses heuristic quadratic damping (gamma * A_t^2) without direct derivation from multi-agent queueing stability constraints.
  Action: Incorporate a brief subsection or discussion connecting the quadratic damping parameter to stability bounds in distributed token queueing systems.
- [MINOR] (rigor) Network jitter and propagation delays are modeled via synthetic Gaussian distributions (N(12.5, 3.2^2) ms), which effectively capture transmission variance but omit asymmetric partitioning and tail latency spikes typical of physical WAN environments.
  Action: Acknowledge tail latency extremes in distributed WAN deployments and outline fault-tolerant sliding window consensus gates as future hardening steps.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The integration of time-series forecasting results (3-point moving average vs naive persistence) appears somewhat decentralized across sections, making its direct operational impact on buffer TTL triggering harder to trace.
  Action: Consolidate the forecasting baseline discussion into a dedicated subsection within Section 4 that explicitly ties forecasting error metrics to adaptive TTL adjustments.
- [MINOR] (scope) Evaluations are currently scoped to standardized single-turn/multi-step reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MBPP), leaving open-ended multi-agent tool-use workflows as future work.
  Action: Explicitly discuss how the decentralized quorum buffer can be extended to track tool execution error feedback in multi-turn agentic environments.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the field's landscape, prior work, crowded lanes, and the novelty bar — consult it while revising so the updated hypothesis stays genuinely novel and well-positioned.

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the current hypothesis and REVISE it
to incorporate new evidence. Keep the core idea — refine, narrow, or strengthen it.

1. Does the evidence support the hypothesis? Narrow or broaden scope as needed.
2. Which claims now have strong evidence? Which are still unsupported?
3. Should the hypothesis become more specific based on what we've learned?
4. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly.

STABILITY IS OK: If progress is good and evidence supports the current direction, keep the
hypothesis similar or identical. Only make substantive changes when evidence clearly calls for
them — e.g., contradictory results, fundamental reviewer critiques, or findings that refine scope.

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — how does this revised hypothesis relate to the previous one?
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the H↔H relation fields) AND the full
list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

**Analyzing and Structuring the Hypothesis Revision**

Okay, here's the game plan for this `upd_hypo` step in iteration 8. We're at Step 3.6, so let's get this right. First, I need to revise the hypothesis based on the latest data, artifacts, and reviewer feedback. I'll need to formulate the Hypothesis-Hypothesis (H↔H) relation, defining the `relation_type`, `relation_rationale`, `confidence_delta`, and `key_changes`. Crucially, I have to formulate Artifact-Artifact (A↔A) relations for the new artifacts.

Here are the new artifacts: `art_7Nocb6OvRzGf` (research: "WAN Resilience & Tool-Use Agent Workflows"), and `art_4mKiL1atNoOK` (experiment: "Moving Average vs Naive Persistence Forecasting").  I need to figure out how they relate to their dependencies. For `art_7Nocb6OvRzGf`, the dependencies are `art_h11bcu8G-AyX` (research: WAN Deployment & Adaptive TTL Quorum) and `art_A7DAajT4V8Ll` (research: Network Complexity & Scope Bounds in Multi-Agent Quorum Systems). `art_4mKiL1atNoOK` depends on `art_vxt31vyLKAXT` (dataset: Reasoning Benchmarks with Prompt Paraphrases).

Let's break down those relationships. For `art_7Nocb6OvRzGf` and `art_h11bcu8G-AyX`, `extends` is the best choice: the former builds upon and expands the latter's foundational work. The relationship between `art_7Nocb6OvRzGf` and `art_A7DAajT4V8Ll` is likely `uses` or `extends` since it builds upon concepts laid out.  Finally, `art_4mKiL1atNoOK` clearly `uses` the benchmark dataset from `art_vxt31vyLKAXT`.

Now for the feedback, I need to address the reviewer's points:
*   Quadratic damping parameter to stability bounds.
*   Acknowledge tail latency extremes and fault-tolerant consensus gates.
*   Consolidate the forecasting baseline into a dedicated section, tying it to TTL adjustments.
*   Discuss the extension of the quorum buffer to error feedback in multi-turn environments.

My instinct is to use the `think` skill to organize these components.  Before that, I want to make sure I know where this JSON file goes and whether the directory exists. I'll double-check the path to the output, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_8/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`, and make sure the `upd_hypo` directory exists, using the `terminal` or `file_editor` to write to the file directly.

**Verifying the File Path**

Okay, so I need to make absolutely sure I've got the correct save location for `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`. It's crucial for the next step. Let's see... the path should be `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_8/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`. Got it.

Now, before I proceed with any writing or saving, I need to confirm that this parent directory actually exists. I'll quickly check using either the `terminal` or the `file_editor` to ensure there are no issues. This quick check will prevent any unexpected errors later on.

**JSON Generation for Resilient Multi-Agent Reasoning**

Okay, time to generate that JSON file. I need to make sure it precisely adheres to the schema. Let me quickly run through the requirements: title, hypothesis, relation rationale, confidence delta, key changes, relation type, and artifact relations, which includes detailed information on artifact relationships.

I need to double-check these artifact IDs and dependencies: `art_7Nocb6OvRzGf` (depends on `art_h11bcu8G-AyX`, `art_A7DAajT4V8Ll`) and `art_4mKiL1atNoOK` (depends on `art_vxt31vyLKAXT`).

Here's how I'm thinking about structuring the JSON content. I've got to make sure the key elements are reflected accurately in the hypothesis, and the rationale is concise but informative. The confidence has definitely increased. My key changes section needs to clearly outline the main advancements, especially the stability bounds with respect to distributed token queueing, the integration of WAN concerns, and the extension of the quorum buffers. The overarching relation type is "evolution" here. The artifact relations reflect this evolution and demonstrate dependencies and uses for the new artifacts.

Now I can use the `file_editor` to create the JSON file using these specifications.

**Validating the JSON - Gotta Make Sure It's Solid**

Right, time to get my hands dirty. First things first: this JSON file needs to be bulletproof. Before I even *think* about running anything on it, I need to make absolutely sure it's valid. No point wasting time debugging downstream issues if the input itself is flawed.

So, I'm thinking Python is the way to go here. It's quick, reliable, and has excellent libraries for JSON schema validation and parsing. I'll whip up a quick script. It'll be a basic check to ensure compliance with the schema and also that it parses without any unexpected errors. This will save me a ton of headache later on. Gotta be diligent, and take the appropriate steps!

Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Final Assessment: Ready for Closure**

Alright, after meticulously reviewing the entire process, I'm confident that everything checks out. No red flags, no outstanding issues, and the deliverables demonstrably meet all stipulated requirements. The data is validated, the logic holds, and the outputs are precisely as expected. It's reached that satisfying point where further review is simply a formality. Therefore, from my perspective, we're unequivocally in a position to execute the final `finish` tool. Time to move this project across the finish line.
