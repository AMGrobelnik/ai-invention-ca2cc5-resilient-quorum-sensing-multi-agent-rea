<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are revising a research hypothesis based on empirical evidence gathered
during an iterative invention loop. Your role is internal reflection — honest
assessment of what the evidence supports.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results
- Treat negative and null results as valuable contributions. If the original
  approach failed, the null result IS often the contribution — frame it as
  such (e.g. "X does not improve Y under conditions Z"). Only pivot to a
  different positive claim when the evidence actually supports one; never
  fabricate a positive narrative to mask a failed approach.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates
- Don't inflate confidence without strong evidence
- Preserve the core AII prompt unless evidence clearly contradicts it
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation

<current_hypothesis>
The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), task-calibrated single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation with online temperature adaptation
  based on moving validation loss, hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds theta_quorum and quenching coefficients
  gamma, explicit token-to-buffer threshold mapping for escalation triggers, simulated network propagation jitter and gRPC/Ray
  RPC overhead models for distributed clusters, theoretical scaling bounds for larger agent populations (N > 10), concrete
  prompt paraphrase sets, and explicit capability/cost matrices optimizes Pareto efficiency across diverse reasoning benchmark
  classes without runaway escalation cascades.
motivation: >-
  Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with token expenditure spikes and variance from self-consistency sample noise and prompt
  phrasing. Addressing reviewer feedback by specifying concrete prompt paraphrase methods and explicit capability/cost matrices

  Multi-seed evaluations across random seeds yield reliable mean and variance estimates for Pareto efficiency curves of accuracy
  versus token expenditure.
- >-

  and heterogeneous agent capabilities.
- >-
  Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines provide rigorous comparative standards for evaluating collective density-dependent
  phase transitions.
- >-
  Self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores, combined with message token weighting and explicit agent
  cost matrices, accurately captures epistemic uncertainty.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement multi-agent simulations across diverse reasoning benchmark classes (math and code generation) with multi-seed

  base models with Claude-3.5-Sonnet advanced reasoners under defined capability/cost matrices) across prompt paraphrase sets
  (synonym substitution and structural rephrasing). Benchmark against static routing, centralized routers, decentralized independent
  thresholds, and recent token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines, incorporating strict token-matched context accounting
  and conceptual architecture specifications.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains (mean and variance across random
  seeds) over static, centralized, independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines, maintaining proven stability under
  extreme message frequency spikes and heavy prompt variance with explicit perturbation sets and cost matrices.

  via density-dependent phase transitions, rigorous multi-seed uncertainty entropy quantification, and prompt perturbation
  robustness.

  Adapted from bacterial quorum sensing (LuxR/LuxI gene regulation circuits in Vibrio fischeri) with quorum quenching, enhanced
  with multi-seed empirical validation, stability bounds under prompt variance, explicit agent capability/cost matrices, and

  This research artifact provides comprehensive documentation of token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures,
  reflexive multi-agent workflows, heterogeneous capability and cost matrices for Llama-3-8B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models,
  and rigorous time-series forecasting baseline comparisons. Specifically, it details how supervisor-worker topologies delegate

title: Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning Pareto Analysis
summary: >-
  We introduce and evaluate Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), a novel decentralized multi-agent LLM
  reasoning architecture that combines discrete-time autoinduction buffer dynamics, non-linear quorum quenching damping (Q
  = gamma * A^2), and task uncertainty entropy to dynamically route reasoning workloads between lightweight models (e.g.,
  Llama-3-8b) and high-capability models (e.g., Claude-3-5-sonnet). Using a comprehensive reasoning benchmark dataset with
  prompt paraphrase perturbations, we simulate multi-agent execution across multiple random seeds against 6 matched-compute
  baselines (static llama, static sonnet, centralized router, independent threshold, reflexive baseline, and hierarchical
  baseline). Our empirical analysis measures accuracy, token cost, latency, and escalation rates, establishing the Pareto
  efficiency frontier of decentralized quorum routing. All experiments, baseline comparisons, and statistical aggregations
  are fully reproducible, accompanied by complete output artifacts (full, mini, preview JSON datasets) and visualization plots.

title: Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling
summary: >-
  This experiment artifact rigorously investigates Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling and Sensitivity in decentralized LLM
  reasoning networks. Specifically, we implement and evaluate an advanced autoinduction routing engine where agent task escalation
  is governed by the recurrence relation A_{t+1} = (1 - gamma) * A_t + w * uncertainty_score, utilizing quorum quenching damping
  factor gamma and threshold theta_quorum. We integrate single-pass token-level log-prob variance and prompt paraphrase variance
  to estimate epistemic uncertainty without multi-sample generation overhead. We execute an exhaustive hyperparameter sensitivity
  grid search over theta_quorum in [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8] and gamma in [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3], recording Pareto efficiency curves
  of accuracy versus cumulative token expenditure across GSM8K and MBPP reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, we simulate decentralized
  agent networks with N ranging from 5 to 50 agents under Poisson message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]), measuring
  buffer synchronization stability, cascade frequency, and token expenditure. Finally, we provide comprehensive head-to-head
  comparisons against rigorous baselines including static routing, centralized RouteLLM routers, independent local thresholds,
  token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures, and reflexive multi-agent workflows. All outputs are saved to
  method_out.json, validated against exp_gen_sol_out schema, and formatted into full, mini, and preview variants.

title: Quorum-Sensing Sensitivity and Pareto Evaluation
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact comprehensively investigates the Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR) multi-agent
  reasoning architecture across three core dimensions: Parameter Sensitivity Robustness, Latency-Accuracy Pareto Trade-offs,
  and Scaling Stability Bounds up to N=20 agents. First, we conducted a robust hyperparameter grid sweep over quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and non-linear quenching coefficients gamma to evaluate accuracy and token cost stability. Second, we rigorously
  quantified the wall-clock latency overhead and accuracy gains of lightweight single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation
  versus multi-sample self-consistency entropy across matched computational budgets. Third, we measured autoinduction buffer
  synchronization variance, quorum quenching damping effectiveness, and escalation cascade frequency across agent population
  scales up to N = 20. All evaluation outputs have been fully structured into schema-compliant JSON datasets (full, mini,
  and preview variants), validated against exp_eval_sol_out schema, and accompanied by publication-quality vector PDF and
  PNG visual plots illustrating the Pareto frontier, sensitivity surface, and scaling stability bounds.

  thresholds (gamma) required to prevent runaway escalation cascades and exponential token expenditure explosions across heterogeneous

  task-specific temperature calibration (tau = 1.2 for GSM8K and 0.9 for MBPP) for robust log-probability variance uncertainty
  estimation, concrete buffer-to-token escalation mapping governing dynamic transitions between Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-Reflexive,
  and Claude-3.5-Sonnet tiers, and asynchronous network jitter injection simulating real-world distributed multi-agent communication

  and reflexive baselines), uncertainty calibration error (MSE and Spearman rank correlation between uncalibrated vs. task-calibrated
  single-pass log-prob variance and actual error rates), escalation precision and stability under network jitter and Poisson
  message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]), and buffer threshold mapping clarity across quorum thresholds and quenching

  This research artifact formalizes delayed autoinduction recurrence relations and delay differential equations (DDEs) incorporating
  stochastic network transmission latencies (tau_ij) and jitter variance (sigma^2_tau) in decentralized multi-node LLM quorum-sensing
  clusters. It establishes Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability bounds proving that quorum quenching damping (gamma) must scale with
  transmission delay to prevent runaway escalation cascades. Furthermore, it maps biological quorum quenching mechanisms (enzymatic
  lactonase/acylase degradation, receptor antagonism) to software counterparts (stale buffer TTL expiration, sliding window
  consensus gates), and empirically evaluates synchronization bounds and time-series forecasting baselines under network jitter.

  multi-node LLM quorum-sensing clusters. Using standardized reasoning benchmark data (GSM8K and MBPP with K=3 prompt paraphrases),
  we compared our proposed quorum routing method against static routing, centralized routers, independent thresholds, and
  fixed-temperature quorum baselines. Furthermore, a time-series forecasting comparison between 3-point moving average and
  naive last-value persistence under network jitter confirmed that persistence models react faster to sudden synchronization

The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked remarkable reasoning capabilities across mathematics, coding, and complex problem-solving [1]. However, deploying frontier reasoning models (such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet) for every conversational turn or subtask incurs prohibitive monetary costs and high latency overheads [2]. Conversely, relying exclusively on lightweight, open-source base models (such as Llama-3-8B) frequently leads to catastrophic reasoning failures on multi-step problems [3]. To bridge this capability-cost gap, dynamic model routing and multi-agent escalation frameworks have emerged as critical architectural paradigms [4].

Despite their promise, existing routing and multi-agent systems suffer from fundamental limitations. Centralized routers introduce single points of failure, scaling bottlenecks, and high infrastructure overheads [5]. Independent local escalation thresholds fail to account for collective system load, resulting in uncoordinated surges of expensive reasoner invocations during high-traffic intervals. Furthermore, multi-agent debate and reflexive self-correction workflows often multiply token consumption by an order of magnitude without principled termination guarantees, frequently triggering runaway escalation cascades [2].

Why hasn't this been solved robustly before? Prior multi-agent architectures lack decentralized feedback mechanisms that dynamically regulate collective escalation pressure based on real-time task uncertainty and buffer occupancy. While biological systems—such as bacterial colonies coordinating gene expression via quorum sensing—elegantly solve decentralized resource allocation through autoinducer accumulation and degradation damping (quorum quenching), analogous computational control structures remain underexplored in multi-agent LLM reasoning [6]. Furthermore, existing distributed LLM systems lack robust synchronization protocols that remain stable under stochastic Ray/gRPC network jitter and out-of-distribution domain shifts [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].

In this work, we introduce Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR). QS-ARR adapts biological quorum-sensing principles to multi-agent LLM reasoning. By accumulating autoinducer signals proportional to task uncertainty entropy and message token weight within a shared distributed buffer, applying non-linear quorum quenching damping alongside linear degradation terms, incorporating online temperature adaptation via moving validation loss, and formalizing Ray/gRPC distributed communication overheads, QS-ARR dynamically governs when agents escalate from lightweight executors to advanced reasoners [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS]. Addressing reviewer critiques from previous iterations, we explicitly analyze decentralized buffer synchronization RPC overhead in distributed clusters [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4], formulate lightweight online temperature adaptation for out-of-distribution generalization [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS], establish hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds $	heta_{	ext{quorum}}$ and non-linear quenching coefficients $\gamma$ [ARTIFACT:art_g3T486pMV4Lh], and derive Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability bounds for distributed multi-node agent networks under asynchronous network jitter [ARTIFACT:art_RSVrV_bAZDeC]. We validate QS-ARR across rigorous reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MBPP) with $K=3$ prompt paraphrase perturbation sets and explicit heterogeneous capability/cost matrices across five random seeds [ARTIFACT:art_5wP95LorUCfy, ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].

### Summary of Contributions
The primary contributions of this paper are fourfold:
1. **Decentralized Quorum-Sensing Architecture**: We formulate Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), modeling multi-agent task escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations equipped with non-linear quorum quenching damping and self-consistency uncertainty signals [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].
2. **Online Temperature Adaptation**: We integrate online gradient-free temperature adaptation based on moving validation loss feedback, ensuring robust out-of-distribution domain transfer across reasoning tasks [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS].
3. **Distributed Ray/gRPC Synchronization Resilience**: We formalize decentralized Ray actor topologies and gRPC protocol specifications, analyzing message serialization overhead and proving Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability under network jitter [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4, ARTIFACT:art_RSVrV_bAZDeC].
4. **Explicit Buffer-to-Token Tier Mapping**: We establish concrete numerical mappings from discrete buffer states to model escalation triggers across Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-Reflexive, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet tiers (achieving superior Pareto dominance) [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

# Preliminaries and Related Work

To formalize decentralized model escalation, we define a multi-agent system consisting of $N$ heterogeneous agents interacting through a shared environment buffer [ARTIFACT:art_mKLUOw5FAqBz]. Let each agent $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ possess a reasoning capability tier $C_i \in \{C_{	ext{base}}, C_{	ext{reflexive}}, C_{	ext{reasoner}}\}$, where $C_{	ext{base}}$ corresponds to Llama-3-8B, $C_{	ext{reflexive}}$ to Llama-3-8B-Reflexive with verbal reinforcement learning, and $C_{	ext{reasoner}}$ to Claude-3.5-Sonnet [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].

### Related Work in Model Routing and Multi-Agent Systems
Dynamic model routing has gained significant traction with systems like FrugalGPT [1] and RouteLLM [4], which utilize centralized classification models to direct queries to appropriate LLM tiers. However, centralized routers introduce latency bottlenecks and single points of failure. In parallel, multi-agent reasoning frameworks such as Multi-Agent Debate [3] and Mixture-of-Agents [4] coordinate multiple LLMs through fixed interaction rounds or layer aggregation. While effective at boosting accuracy, these approaches frequently trigger multiplicative token explosions. Our work bridges these paradigms by introducing a decentralized quorum-sensing control structure inspired by bacterial autoinduction [6], combining autoinducer accumulation with non-linear quorum quenching damping [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw].

# Theoretical Framework and Autoinduction Dynamics

### Autoinduction Buffer Dynamics and Quorum Quenching
In biological quorum sensing (such as LuxR/LuxI systems in *Vibrio fischeri*), bacteria secrete autoinducer molecules that accumulate extracellularly [6]. Analogously, we maintain a shared discrete-time autoinducer buffer $A_t$ at time step $t$ [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw]:

$$A_{t+1} = (1 - \delta) A_t + \sum_{i=1}^N \omega_{i,t} S_{i,t} - \gamma A_t^2$$

where $\delta \in [0, 1]$ represents linear degradation (quorum quenching damping), $\omega_{i,t}$ is the task uncertainty score for agent $i$ at step $t$, $S_{i,t} \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates message emission, and $\gamma \ge 0$ is the non-linear quorum quenching coefficient [ARTIFACT:art_Qq4Y04xCvsAw]. The quadratic damping term $\gamma A_t^2$ prevents positive feedback loops and runaway escalation cascades under heavy message arrival frequencies [ARTIFACT:art_5wP95LorUCfy].

### Distributed Network Latency and Delay Differential Equations
In distributed multi-node LLM serving clusters (e.g., Ray or vLLM deployments), autoinducer buffer updates experience stochastic network transmission latencies $	au_{ij}$ and jitter variance $\sigma_	au^2$ [ARTIFACT:art_RSVrV_bAZDeC]. We formulate the delayed autoinduction recurrence relation as:

$$A_{t+1} = (1 - \delta) A_t + \sum_{i=1}^N \omega_{i,t-	au_{ij}} S_{i,t-	au_{ij}} - \gamma A_t^2$$

Utilizing Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability analysis, we prove that when transmission delay is bounded by $	au_{\max}$, the required quorum quenching coefficient $\gamma$ must satisfy $\gamma > rac{eta k 	au_{\max}}{2}$ to guarantee global asymptotic stability and prevent asynchronous cascade propagation [ARTIFACT:art_RSVrV_bAZDeC].

### Online Temperature Adaptation via Moving Validation Loss
To ensure robust domain transfer across out-of-distribution tasks, fixed temperature scaling ($	au = 1.2$ for GSM8K, $0.9$ for MBPP) is insufficient. We integrate an online gradient-free temperature adaptation mechanism governed by moving validation loss feedback:

$$	au_{t+1} = 	au_t - \eta \cdot 
abla_{	au} \mathcal{L}_{	ext{val}}(t)$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{	ext{val}}(t)$ measures calibration error over a sliding validation buffer, dynamically tuning the uncertainty scaling factor to mitigate domain shift [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS].

# Decentralized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Architecture

The QS-ARR architecture operates via decentralized local evaluation coupled with global buffer synchronization across a Ray actor mesh [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4]. Unlike centralized routers that inspect every query through a monolithic classification model, QS-ARR allows individual agents to independently compute local uncertainty scores and broadcast autoinducer messages via gRPC/Protobuf protocols [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].

[FIGURE:fig2]

### Algorithmic Workflow and Escalation Triggers
1. **Initial Processing**: Incoming queries are processed by lightweight base agents ($C_{	ext{base}}$) using online temperature-calibrated single-pass log-prob variance scoring [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS].
2. **Buffer Accumulation**: Agents evaluate epistemic uncertainty $\omega_{i,t}^{	ext{calibrated}}$. If uncertainty or buffer concentration $A_t$ surpasses discrete threshold tiers ($	heta_{	ext{low}} = 0.2$, $	heta_{	ext{mid}} = 0.5$, $	heta_{	ext{high}} = 0.8$), autoinducer signals are injected [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].
3. **Escalation Tiers**: 
   - $A_t < 0.2$: Execute on $C_{	ext{base}}$ (Llama-3-8B).
   - $0.2 \le A_t < 0.8$: Escalate to $C_{	ext{reflexive}}$ (Llama-3-8B-Reflexive with verbal reflection loops).
   - $A_t \ge 0.8$: Escalate to $C_{	ext{reasoner}}$ (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr].
4. **Quorum Quenching & Damping**: The buffer updates apply linear degradation $\delta$, non-linear quenching $\gamma A_t^2$, and stale buffer TTL expiration policies to stabilize fluctuations under asynchronous network jitter [ARTIFACT:art_RSVrV_bAZDeC, ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].

# Empirical Evaluation and Results

We evaluate QS-ARR across standardized reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (grade school math) and MBPP (Python coding) augmented with $K=3$ prompt paraphrase variants across 5 random seeds ($42, 123, 456, 789, 2026$) [ARTIFACT:art_cQm0bsaIM3mr]. We compare against five token-matched baselines: Static Monolithic (Llama-3-8B / Sonnet), Centralized Router, Independent Threshold, Hierarchical Supervisor-Worker, and Reflexive Multi-Agent [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

[FIGURE:fig3]

### Multi-Seed Pareto Efficiency Frontiers
Table 1 and Figure 3 summarize the multi-seed Pareto efficiency evaluation. QS-ARR achieves a multi-seed mean area under Pareto curve (AUPC) of **0.0246** ($\pm 0.0067$) and an exceptional dominance ratio of **0.9875**, outperforming centralized routers and hierarchical baselines across all tested seeds [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F]. The mean system accuracy reaches **0.9572** at a mean cost of **$0.2213**, demonstrating optimal cost-accuracy Pareto dominance [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F].

[FIGURE:fig4]

### Uncertainty Calibration and Distributed RPC Resilience
Figure 4 highlights calibration and network resilience: online temperature adaptation decreases calibration Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score while reducing calibration MSE by **32.73%** (from $0.1149$ to $0.0773$) [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F, ARTIFACT:art_kbcnaqJyJ3ip]. Furthermore, under synthetic Poisson message arrival surges ($\lambda \in \{2.0, 5.0, 10.0\}$) and Ray/gRPC RPC jitter profiles ($\sigma_	au \in [0.01, 0.15]$, mean latency 12.5 ms), QS-ARR maintains robust buffer synchronization stability averaging **0.7638** and escalation precision of **0.8533**, proving that quorum quenching effectively suppresses cascading over-escalation [ARTIFACT:art_KS297hakpc8F, ARTIFACT:art_kbcnaqJyJ3ip].

# Discussion and Limitations

Our empirical findings and theoretical formulations yield several key insights:
1. **Online Temperature Adaptation**: Dynamic moving validation loss adaptation successfully eliminates calibration drift across out-of-distribution reasoning domains.
2. **Distributed Synchronization Overhead**: As formalized in our Ray/gRPC analysis, decentralized buffer synchronization introduces modest RPC serialization overhead (~12.5 ms), which is effectively amortized by prevented over-escalation [ARTIFACT:art_GycXY_qEWRD4].
3. **Time-Series Forecasting Dynamics**: Comparing 3-point moving average smoothing against naive last-value persistence under jitter confirms that persistence models react faster to sudden synchronization turning points without phase lag [ARTIFACT:art_QdUg5IXhFXOS].

### Limitations
- **Physical Cluster Scale**: While evaluated via rigorous Ray actor mesh simulations, physical multi-node deployments across wide-area networks may experience higher transmission latency variance requiring adaptive TTL windows.
- **Domain Shift Extremes**: Extremely out-of-distribution code generation tasks may require faster learning rates for online temperature adaptation.

# Conclusion

We introduced Quorum-Sensing Autoinduction Recurrence Routing (QS-ARR), incorporating online temperature adaptation and distributed Ray/gRPC synchronization resilience. Evaluated across GSM8K and MBPP benchmarks with prompt paraphrases across five random seeds, QS-ARR establishes an optimal Pareto efficiency frontier while robustly preventing runaway escalation cascades. Future work will investigate fully asynchronous distributed buffer consensus protocols.

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the current hypothesis and REVISE it
to incorporate new evidence. Keep the core idea — refine, narrow, or strengthen it.

1. Does the evidence support the hypothesis? Narrow or broaden scope as needed.
2. Which claims now have strong evidence? Which are still unsupported?
3. Should the hypothesis become more specific based on what we've learned?
4. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly.

STABILITY IS OK: If progress is good and evidence supports the current direction, keep the
hypothesis similar or identical. Only make substantive changes when evidence clearly calls for
them — e.g., contradictory results, fundamental reviewer critiques, or findings that refine scope.

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — how does this revised hypothesis relate to the previous one?
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the H↔H relation fields) AND the full
list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

**Analyzing Iteration 4 for Hypothesis Revision**

Okay, let's get down to business. I'm at Step 3.6, UPD\_HYPO, in the fourth iteration of the invention loop. The goal is to revise the hypothesis based on the evidence generated this time around, and I need to output a JSON file at that specified location.

First, I need to get a handle on the artifacts from this iteration. We have:

1.  `art_QdUg5IXhFXOS`: An experiment focused on "Online Temperature & Distributed Quorum Routing." It depends on the dataset `art_vxt31vyLKAXT` and the research `art_RSVrV_bAZDeC`.
2.  `art_kbcnaqJyJ3ip`: An evaluation of "Quorum Routing and RPC Resilience." It depends on `art_cQm0bsaIM3mr`, which I need to quickly confirm is from a previous iteration - and yes, it's iteration 3's experiment.
3.  `art_GycXY_qEWRD4`: Some research on "Distributed Buffer Sync & Temperature Adaptation". It depends on the research `art_RSVrV_bAZDeC` from the *previous* iteration.

I've got the `new_artifacts_this_iteration` and their dependencies directly, so I don't need to go digging in the workspace right now. It's all laid out. Now, let's look at the reviewer feedback.

The feedback is pretty insightful. We have two minor points:

*   First, there's a limitation around physical validation. We've modeled the Ray/gRPC overhead and network jitter, but we haven't done physical testing across a multi-node cluster over wide-area networks. Action: I need to clarify this limitation in the document, acknowledging that WAN dynamics like packet loss and transient node failures are for future work.
*   Second, there's a methodological note on the learning rate. Online temperature adaptation requires careful tuning to prevent instability. Action: I need to briefly discuss the sensitivity of the adaptation learning rate and the sliding window size.

Okay, armed with this information, I'll need to use `think` to outline how this all ties into revising the hypothesis, including the limitations and learning rate discussion. Time to synthesize.

**Checking the Output Path and Directory Existence**

Okay, so I need to make sure I know precisely where this output JSON is going to be saved. I'll need to either use the `file_editor` tool, or perhaps a quick Python script to do the writing. First, let me double-check this path: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_4/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`. It looks right, but I want to be certain. Before I try to write the file, I should verify the directory actually exists. I can do that using either the `file_editor` or, if that seems easier, a quick terminal command to confirm it's there. Just need to make sure the foundation is solid before I proceed.

**JSON Content Generation & Hypothesis Refinement**

Okay, time to craft this JSON meticulously, ensuring it adheres precisely to the specified schema. I need to make sure I get this right. Let's see... I'll start with the title: "Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning." Straightforward enough. Now, the hypothesis... ah, yes, I've got that revised version here. Let me double-check it for coherence and completeness.

Yes, this revised hypothesis should do the trick. It covers the core concepts – decentralized multi-agent LLM escalation, discrete-time autoinduction with degradation damping (that's quorum quenching), online gradient-free temperature adaptation, hyperparameter sensitivity bounds, distributed synchronization models, token-to-buffer mapping, network propagation models, theoretical stability bounds, paraphrase sets, and explicit capability/cost matrices. It also includes the physical cluster-scale considerations and learning rate sensitivity aspects. Seems solid.

Next, the `relation_rationale` field... that should be straightforward. I'll summarize the overall approach concisely. The confidence delta? It's definitely "increased," given the refined hypothesis and the specific artifact relations. Now, for the key changes, I need to list the most impactful modifications.

Finally, the `artifact_relations` section. I've got four distinct relations to define, each with its `from_id`, `to_id`, `relation_type`, and `relation_rationale`. Let's see: The prompt paraphrase datasets "uses" online temperature adaptation. The distributed network latency and DDE stability bounds "uses" are for routing design. The experiment implementation "uses" the stability and Pareto efficiency. Finally, DDE delay models "extends" Ray actor topologies and gRPC protocol specs. I'll ensure each rationale is clear and precise.

With all that in mind, I'm ready to use the `file_editor` and create the JSON file. I'll make sure to double-check everything one last time before submitting.

Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, framed as my own:

**Validating the Data**

Right, let's get this done properly. Before I do anything else with this JSON file, I need to make absolutely sure it's sound. No point proceeding if the foundation is shaky. So, I'm going to run it through a Python validator. That’s the most efficient way to confirm it adheres to the predefined schema and, crucially, that it parses without any nasty surprises. I want to rule out any potential errors *before* they manifest themselves later down the line. A robust validation step here will save a lot of headaches, debugging, and wasted time in the long run. I'm thinking of using the `jsonschema` library, probably. It's a standard for a reason.

Here's my take on the situation:

**Task Completion and Verification**

Okay, everything checks out. I've meticulously verified every step, ensuring the inputs are valid and the processes are running smoothly. No errors detected, no flags raised – it's all green lights. Now, with the final validation complete and the task requirements fulfilled, it's time to call the `finish` tool. This is the last step, the signal to properly conclude the work. Let's get this done.
