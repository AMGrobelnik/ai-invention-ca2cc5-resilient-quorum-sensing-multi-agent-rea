<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

````
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), self-consistency entropy uncertainty signals, hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and non-linear quenching coefficients gamma, lightweight single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation to mitigate
  latency bottlenecks, theoretical scaling bounds for larger agent populations (N > 10), concrete prompt paraphrase sets,
  explicit capability/cost matrices for heterogeneous agent pairs (Llama-3-8B base vs. Claude-3.5-Sonnet reasoner), multi-seed
  empirical validation, and token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines optimizes Pareto efficiency across diverse
  reasoning benchmark classes without runaway escalation cascades.
motivation: >-
  Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with token expenditure spikes and variance from self-consistency sample noise and prompt
  phrasing. Addressing reviewer feedback by specifying concrete prompt paraphrase methods and explicit capability/cost matrices
  for heterogeneous agents establishes robust reproducibility and true Pareto dominance under extreme message frequency spikes.
assumptions:
- >-
  Multi-seed evaluations across random seeds yield reliable mean and variance estimates for Pareto efficiency curves of accuracy
  versus token expenditure.
- >-
  Theoretical stability bounds for degradation damping (quorum quenching) remain robust under heavy prompt-length variance
  and heterogeneous agent capabilities.
- >-
  Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines provide rigorous comparative standards for evaluating collective density-dependent
  phase transitions.
- >-
  Self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores, combined with message token weighting and explicit agent
  cost matrices, accurately captures epistemic uncertainty.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement multi-agent simulations across diverse reasoning benchmark classes (math and code generation) with multi-seed
  runs reporting mean and variance. Test degradation rates, Hill coefficients, and explicit agent heterogeneity (pairing Llama-3-8B
  base models with Claude-3.5-Sonnet advanced reasoners under defined capability/cost matrices) across prompt paraphrase sets
  (synonym substitution and structural rephrasing). Benchmark against static routing, centralized routers, decentralized independent
  thresholds, and recent token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines, incorporating strict token-matched context accounting
  and conceptual architecture specifications.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains (mean and variance across random
  seeds) over static, centralized, independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines, maintaining proven stability under
  extreme message frequency spikes and heavy prompt variance with explicit perturbation sets and cost matrices.
related_works:
- >-
  RouteLLM / OmniRouter: Centralized router for model selection; our work provides a decentralized quorum-sensing mechanism
  with multi-seed Pareto validation, explicit agent cost matrices, and stability bounds.
- >-
  Multi-Agent Debate / Mixture-of-Agents: Fixed rounds or layer aggregation; our work adapts biological quorum sensing with
  quorum quenching and empirical robustness checks across heterogeneous agents with defined capability/cost pairings.
- >-
  Hierarchical / Reflexive Agent Baselines: Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive architectures; our work outperforms them
  via density-dependent phase transitions, rigorous multi-seed uncertainty entropy quantification, and prompt perturbation
  robustness.
inspiration: >-
  Adapted from bacterial quorum sensing (LuxR/LuxI gene regulation circuits in Vibrio fischeri) with quorum quenching, enhanced
  with multi-seed empirical validation, stability bounds under prompt variance, explicit agent capability/cost matrices, and
  hierarchical baseline comparison.
terms:
- term: Quorum Sensing
  definition: >-
    A decentralized coordination mechanism where agents adjust behaviors based on collective density through signal accumulation
    in a shared environment.
- term: Autoinducer
  definition: >-
    A signaling molecule produced by agents proportional to task uncertainty and message weight that accumulates in the shared
    buffer.
- term: Quorum Quenching
  definition: >-
    A degradation and damping term in the autoinducer recurrence relation that prevents runaway positive feedback cascades
    under high message frequency.
- term: Model Escalation
  definition: >-
    Dynamically shifting a task from a cheap lightweight model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) to an expensive reasoning model (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
    when collective or local thresholds are crossed.
- term: Capability/Cost Matrix
  definition: >-
    A formal specification mapping heterogeneous agent tiers to their respective per-token monetary costs and reasoning performance
    benchmarks.
summary: >-
  We refine stabilized quorum-sensing multi-agent reasoning by incorporating concrete prompt paraphrase perturbation sets
  and explicit heterogeneous agent capability/cost matrices, achieving robust Pareto efficiency across reasoning benchmarks.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refined hypothesis with parameter sensitivity bounds, lightweight uncertainty estimation, and N > 10 scaling analysis.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Added hyperparameter sensitivity robustness ranges for quorum threshold theta_quorum and quenching coefficient gamma.
- >-
  Integrated lightweight single-pass log-prob variance uncertainty estimation to address latency overhead for borderline queries.
- >-
  Included theoretical scaling bounds for autoinduction buffer synchronization in larger agent networks (N > 10).

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

title: Hierarchical and Reflexive Agent Specifications
summary: >-
  This research artifact provides comprehensive documentation of token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures,
  reflexive multi-agent workflows, heterogeneous capability and cost matrices for Llama-3-8B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models,
  and rigorous time-series forecasting baseline comparisons. Specifically, it details how supervisor-worker topologies delegate
  complex task decomposition and verification to high-capability reasoning models while assigning execution to lightweight
  models under strict token-matching protocols. Furthermore, it establishes exact per-token cost and latency matrices, analyzes
  verbal reinforcement learning reflection loops, and empirically evaluates 3-point moving average versus naive last-value
  forecasting baselines across synthetic oscillatory, random walk, and linear trend series.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
</instructions><user_data>
User-provided reference materials are available at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/user_uploads`. Check this folder for anything relevant to your task.

<user_original_request>
The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.

**My Approach to Generating the Research Plan**

Okay, here's the task: I need to create a detailed JSON plan for the `research_iter2_dir3` artifact and save it at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_research_1/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`. Time to strategize.

First, let's make sure we're leveraging all the relevant information. The instructions specifically highlight domain handbooks, and the prompt implies that expert knowledge is contained within. The relevant handbook listed is `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems`, so I'll prioritize reading that before proceeding – specifically, I will invoke the `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems` skill via `invoke_skill` to start. This is the logical first step, and the instructions are very clear on this point.

Next, I need context. I'll need to understand what has already been done in the previous iteration. I should review the contents of the previous iteration artifact `art_mKLUOw5FAqBz`, or any user uploads, to identify any key data or results from the first iteration. I'll start by exploring the workspace directory; I need to understand what files are available.

My plan then is to:

1.  **Invoke the `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems` skill.** This is the expert knowledge base.
2.  **View Workspace Files:** This will involve checking the workspace to see if the files I need are there. Specifically, I'll need to check the previous iteration artifact `art_mKLUOw5FAqBz`, if it's there, to see where the data is. I think using the `file_editor` tool is the best way to do this. I'll use it with the `view` function on either the current working directory, or the dependency workspace path `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_research_1`, depending on where the `art_mKLUOw5FAqBz` artifact lives.

The star is the SUBSTRATE below \u2014 a dated, source-anchored map of where the field stands mid-2026,\nwith an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions; nothing here prescribes a direction. Every\n[Sn] resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md); date-sensitive figures live in [volatile.md](volatile.md).\n\n## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)\n\n- The newest synthesis organizes the field as the LIFE progression \u2014 Lay the capability foundation \u2192 Integrate\n  through collaboration \u2192 Find faults through attribution \u2192 Evolve through self-improvement \u2014 with the F\u2192E\n  handoff as its named weak link [S2].\n- The failure locus is coordination, not member capability: errors propagate across agents and interaction\n  rounds, are hard to diagnose, and rarely feed back into structure [S2] [S1].\n- The field's working null hypothesis is economic: token spend, not architecture, explains most performance\n  variance, so any structural claim is judged against matched-compute aggregation [S3] [S7].\n- That null now has a theory: at a fixed reasoning-token budget with perfect context use, a single agent is more\n  information-efficient (Data Processing Inequality \u2014 each handoff can only lose information); MAS is predicted\n  competitive only where context use degrades or more compute is spent [S6].\n- Verification is treated as easier than generation, so verifier count is a live test-time scaling axis [S15] \u2014\n  but self-evaluation without an external signal is known to fail and can degrade answers [S16].\n- Inter-agent natural language is a chosen tradeoff, not a given: interpretable and overseeable, but argued\n  structurally misaligned with the vector spaces models compute in (information loss, behavioral drift) [S18].\n\n## Frontier (recency-weighted)\n\n### Structure vs matched compute (weight-capped here \u2014 the saturated core, see repeller)\n\n- First systematic multi-agent-debate evaluation (5 MAD methods \u00d7 9 benchmarks \u00d7 4 models): MAD often fails to\n  beat single-agent CoT / Self-Consistency even at much higher inference compute; the one robust lever found is\n  model heterogeneity, named a universal antidote [S7] (2025-02, rev 2025-06).\n- The critique now has a theory, not just benchmarks: the Data Processing Inequality argument predicts exactly\n  when MAS becomes competitive \u2014 degraded single-agent context use, or extra compute [S6] (2026-04).\n\n### Topology & orchestration\n\n- Adaptive/learned MAS optimized per-benchmark show \"topological overfitting\" (no cross-domain transfer) and\n  \"illusory coordination\" (surface accuracy while interactions diverge from intended behavior) [S9] (2026-04).\n- Live counter-current: task-adaptive topology routing (parallel / sequential / hierarchical / hybrid per task)\n  reports 12\u201323% over static single-topology baselines at identical models \u2014 single-author preprint, directly\n  clashing with [S9]; see Open questions [S10] (2026-02).\n\n### Failure, attribution & repair\n\n- MAST is the field's failure instrument \u2014 exact figures (commonly mis-recalled): taxonomy built from 150 traces\n  (kappa = 0.88), 14 modes / 3 categories; MAST-Data = 1600+ annotated traces, 7 frameworks [S1] (2025-03, rev 2025-10).\n- Failure attribution (which agent, which step) is formalized and benchmarked \u2014 and far from solved: the best\n  automated method reaches 53.5% (Who&When, ICML 2025 Spotlight) [S12] (2025-04).\n- Verifier/critic agents act with a DELAY, so false claims propagate before correction \u2014 yielding instability\n  thresholds and optimal corrector placement (single-author preprint) [S13] (2026-06).\n- E-stage methods arriving: TPGO treats the MAS as a graph of optimizable nodes and derives textual feedback\n  from execution traces to pinpoint failures and suggest granular edits [S14] (2026-04).\n\n### Communication & interop\n\n- The latent-communication thread passes continuous hidden states between agents on the premise that\n  downsampling thought to discrete tokens loses information \u2014 a heavily occupied lane [S17] (2025-11).\n- Protocol scope split a reviewer expects you to know: MCP = model\u2194tools/data (a single open standard replacing\n  per-source connectors); A2A = agent\u2194agent, explicitly complementary to MCP [S4] (2024-11) \u00b7 [S5] (2025-04).\n\n### Evaluation & economics\n\n- MAS eval has moved past final accuracy: MultiAgentBench (ACL 2025) scores collaboration quality with\n  milestone-based KPIs and compares coordination protocols (star / chain / tree / graph) [S20] (2025-03).\n- First independent (non-vendor) cost-accuracy Pareto: over 4 orchestration patterns \u00d7 5 LLMs on 10,000\n  financial documents, reflexive tops F1 (0.943) at 2.3\u00d7 cost; hierarchical supervisor-worker sits on the\n  Pareto frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4\u00d7) [S21] (2026-03).\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed)\n\n- Multi-Agent Verification: scale the NUMBER of off-the-shelf aspect verifiers (binary approve/reject, no\n  training) as the test-time axis \u2014 verification, not more debate rounds [S15] (2025-02).\n- The two production-craft poles, both vendor-staked (2025-06): Cognition \u2014 reliability = context engineering on\n  ONE thread [S19]; Anthropic \u2014 MAS pays off on parallel-heavy, context-exceeding, tool-heavy tasks at ~15\u00d7 token cost [S3].\n- Position line naming the comms tension: NL is structurally misaligned with LLM vector spaces \u2014\n  interpretability bought at an information cost [S18] (2025-06).\n\n## Durable core (the few foundations that still hold)\n\n- Du et al. 2023 \u2014 the founding \"debate improves reasoning\" result; the baseline the skeptic line attacks [S23].\n- Mixture-of-Agents \u2014 layered aggregation, each layer reads all prior-layer outputs; 65.1 vs 57.5 (GPT-4 Omni)\n  on AlpacaEval 2.0 \u2014 read as aggregation until cost-matched [S22].\n- MetaGPT \u2014 canonical role-crew/SOP assembly line;

Once inference compute, sample aggregation, and context-window relief are controlled, what residual \u2014 if\n   any \u2014 do the agentic ingredients (roles, personas, turn-taking, inter-agent dialogue) contribute, and on\n   which task families? The theory predicts MAS wins only under degraded context use or extra compute [S6] [S7];\n   no result yet isolates the residual itself.\n2. What makes a critique or verification signal genuinely EXTERNAL? Self-correction fails without external\n   feedback [S16], task verification is one of MAST's three failure categories [S1] \u2014 so does a same-family\n   peer critic count as external, and where exactly is the boundary?\n3. Same object, opposite 2026 verdicts: task-adaptive topology reports +12\u201323% at identical models [S10], while\n   independent evaluation finds adaptive MAS overfit topologically with illusory coordination [S9], and the\n   claimed cross-domain transfer of searched designs [S11] is measured as no advantage over CoT-SC [S8]. Under\n   what conditions does learned structure transfer, and what evaluation separates real coordination from\n   surface accuracy?\n4. Why do diagnosed failures rarely translate into structural self-improvement [S2]? Attribution is benchmarked\n   (best 53.5% [S12]) and typed blame signals exist [S1] \u2014 what is missing between a localized, typed fault and\n   a safe structural change (the survey's own closed-loop agenda [S2])?\n5. Can MAS reliability be predicted before running rather than measured after? Error propagation is the named\n   failure locus [S2], delay effects already yield instability thresholds and corrector-placement results [S13],\n   and a 1600+-trace corpus exists to fit against [S1] \u2014 yet there is no compositional account mapping\n   per-agent error rates + topology to system reliability.\n6. Is model-pool heterogeneity the actual mechanism behind reported multi-agent gains? It is the quoted\n   \"universal antidote\" and the named reopening condition for the buried debate line [S7] \u2014 would a\n   matched-compute heterogeneous pool beat self-consistency over the single best model?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ship another MAS framework: +X% on one benchmark, unmatched compute, no failure analysis | The rewarded move is a reusable diagnostic instrument \u2014 MAST, \"the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy\"; recognition = independent adoption (IBM applied it to turn raw ITBench traces into structured failure signatures) | problematizes-nothing \u2014 the field's own critique names weak baselines / limited coverage as the incremental signature | L\u00b7B | [S1] [S26] [S7] |\n| Homogeneous multi-agent debate as a reasoning booster | Buried (2025-02\u219206): MAD often loses to CoT/Self-Consistency at higher compute.

**My Plan for Research Artifact `research_iter2_dir3`**

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a plan for a research artifact. The title is pretty clear: "Formulate theoretical scaling bounds and autoinduction buffer synchronization stability proofs for larger agent populations (N > 10)." I know the artifact needs to adhere to the `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` schema, so I'll keep that in mind. I need to generate `title`, `summary`, `runpod_compute_profile` (let's default to `cpu_light`), `question`, `research_plan`, and `explanation`.

I'll revisit the prompt, especially the objective, approach, dependencies, and guidelines to extract the necessary information to get the ball rolling. The artifact direction provides a good starting point: I need to synthesize literature on decentralized quorum-sensing consensus, mean-field approximation of autoinduction recurrence relations, and damping stability criteria under high agent density.

Now, let's formulate a research strategy. My first step is going to be some serious literature research. I'll need to dive into decentralized quorum sensing, mean-field approximations applied to autoinduction, stability bounds for multi-agent systems, and specifically, the relevant math models. I need to be sure to find and document models for autoinduction feedback, especially in larger populations (N > 10), and consider degradation damping or quorum quenching. This means LuxR/LuxI, Goodwin oscillator, and related concepts are key. I'll also need to consider scaling in agent populations and look for token-matched approaches.

Given that this is an open-ended research question, I'm going to leverage web search to gather authoritative references and mathematical formulations. I'll search for things like "quorum sensing equations," "autoinduction recurrence relations," "stability bounds multi-agent systems," "mean-field approximation autoinduction," and similar search terms. I'm going to use the `web_search` tool to gather the information necessary.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

````
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), self-consistency entropy uncertainty signals, hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and non-linear quenching coefficients gamma, lightweight single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation to mitigate
  latency bottlenecks, theoretical scaling bounds for larger agent populations (N > 10), concrete prompt paraphrase sets,
  explicit capability/cost matrices for heterogeneous agent pairs (Llama-3-8B base vs. Claude-3.5-Sonnet reasoner), multi-seed
  empirical validation, and token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines optimizes Pareto efficiency across diverse
  reasoning benchmark classes without runaway escalation cascades.
motivation: >-
  Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with token expenditure spikes and variance from self-consistency sample noise and prompt
  phrasing. Addressing reviewer feedback by specifying concrete prompt paraphrase methods and explicit capability/cost matrices
  for heterogeneous agents establishes robust reproducibility and true Pareto dominance under extreme message frequency spikes.
assumptions:
- >-
  Multi-seed evaluations across random seeds yield reliable mean and variance estimates for Pareto efficiency curves of accuracy
  versus token expenditure.
- >-
  Theoretical stability bounds for degradation damping (quorum quenching) remain robust under heavy prompt-length variance
  and heterogeneous agent capabilities.
- >-
  Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines provide rigorous comparative standards for evaluating collective density-dependent
  phase transitions.
- >-
  Self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores, combined with message token weighting and explicit agent
  cost matrices, accurately captures epistemic uncertainty.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement multi-agent simulations across diverse reasoning benchmark classes (math and code generation) with multi-seed
  runs reporting mean and variance. Test degradation rates, Hill coefficients, and explicit agent heterogeneity (pairing Llama-3-8B
  base models with Claude-3.5-Sonnet advanced reasoners under defined capability/cost matrices) across prompt paraphrase sets
  (synonym substitution and structural rephrasing). Benchmark against static routing, centralized routers, decentralized independent
  thresholds, and recent token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines, incorporating strict token-matched context accounting
  and conceptual architecture specifications.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains (mean and variance across random
  seeds) over static, centralized, independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines, maintaining proven stability under
  extreme message frequency spikes and heavy prompt variance with explicit perturbation sets and cost matrices.
related_works:
- >-
  RouteLLM / OmniRouter: Centralized router for model selection; our work provides a decentralized quorum-sensing mechanism
  with multi-seed Pareto validation, explicit agent cost matrices, and stability bounds.

  quorum quenching and empirical robustness checks across heterogeneous agents with defined capability/cost pairings.
- >-
  Hierarchical / Reflexive Agent Baselines: Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive architectures; our work outperforms them
  via density-dependent phase transitions, rigorous multi-seed uncertainty entropy quantification, and prompt perturbation
  robustness.
inspiration: >-
  Adapted from bacterial quorum sensing (LuxR/LuxI gene regulation circuits in Vibrio fischeri) with quorum quenching, enhanced
  with multi-seed empirical validation, stability bounds under prompt variance, explicit agent capability/cost matrices, and
  hierarchical baseline comparison.
terms:
- term: Quorum Sensing
  definition: >-
    A decentralized coordination mechanism where agents adjust behaviors based on collective density through signal accumulation
    in a shared environment.
- term: Autoinducer
  definition: >-
    A signaling molecule produced by agents proportional to task uncertainty and message weight that accumulates in the shared
    buffer.
- term: Quorum Quenching
  definition: >-
    A degradation and damping term in the autoinducer recurrence relation that prevents runaway positive feedback cascades
    under high message frequency.
- term: Model Escalation
  definition: >-
    Dynamically shifting a task from a cheap lightweight model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) to an expensive reasoning model (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
    when collective or local thresholds are crossed.
- term: Capability/Cost Matrix
  definition: >-
    A formal specification mapping heterogeneous agent tiers to their respective per-token monetary costs and reasoning performance
    benchmarks.
summary: >-
  We refine stabilized quorum-sensing multi-agent reasoning by incorporating concrete prompt paraphrase perturbation sets
  and explicit heterogeneous agent capability/cost matrices, achieving robust Pareto efficiency across reasoning benchmarks.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refined hypothesis with parameter sensitivity bounds, lightweight uncertainty estimation, and N > 10 scaling analysis.
_confidence_delta: increased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Added hyperparameter sensitivity robustness ranges for quorum threshold theta_quorum and quenching coefficient gamma.
- >-
  Integrated lightweight single-pass log-prob variance uncertainty estimation to address latency overhead for borderline queries.
- >-
  Included theoretical scaling bounds for autoinduction buffer synchronization in larger agent networks (N > 10).

  This research artifact provides comprehensive documentation of token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures,
  reflexive multi-agent workflows, heterogeneous capability and cost matrices for Llama-3-8B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models,
  and rigorous time-series forecasting baseline comparisons. Specifically, it details how supervisor-worker topologies delegate
  complex task decomposition and verification to high-capability reasoning models while assigning execution to lightweight
  models under strict token-matching protocols. Furthermore, it establishes exact per-token cost and latency matrices, analyzes
  verbal reinforcement learning reflection loops, and empirically evaluates 3-point moving average versus naive last-value
  forecasting baselines across synthetic oscillatory, random walk, and linear trend series.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: RESEARCH

RESEARCH
Web research to answer key questions — like a researcher making decisions.
Runtime: LLM Agent, no code execution.
Tools: the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text).
Capabilities: Find, synthesize, and compare information across sources; survey SOTA and best practices.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL other RESEARCH to build on prior findings
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The research executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), self-consistency entropy uncertainty signals, hyperparameter sensitivity bounds for quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and non-linear quenching coefficients gamma, lightweight single-pass log-prob uncertainty estimation to mitigate
  latency bottlenecks, theoretical scaling bounds for larger agent populations (N > 10), concrete prompt paraphrase sets,
  explicit capability/cost matrices for heterogeneous agent pairs (Llama-3-8B base vs. Claude-3.5-Sonnet reasoner), multi-seed
  empirical validation, and token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines optimizes Pareto efficiency across diverse
  reasoning benchmark classes without runaway escalation cascades.
motivation: >-
  Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with token expenditure spikes and variance from self-consistency sample noise and prompt
  phrasing. Addressing reviewer feedback by specifying concrete prompt paraphrase methods and explicit capability/cost matrices
  for heterogeneous agents establishes robust reproducibility and true Pareto dominance under extreme message frequency spikes.
assumptions:
- >-
  Multi-seed evaluations across random seeds yield reliable mean and variance estimates for Pareto efficiency curves of accuracy
  versus token expenditure.
- >-
  Theoretical stability bounds for degradation damping (quorum quenching) remain robust under heavy prompt-length variance
  and heterogeneous agent capabilities.
- >-
  Token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines provide rigorous comparative standards for evaluating collective density-dependent
  phase transitions.
- >-
  Self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores, combined with message token weighting and explicit agent
  cost matrices, accurately captures epistemic uncertainty.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement multi-agent simulations across diverse reasoning benchmark classes (math and code generation) with multi-seed
  runs reporting mean and variance. Test degradation rates, Hill coefficients, and explicit agent heterogeneity (pairing Llama-3-8B
  base models with Claude-3.5-Sonnet advanced reasoners under defined capability/cost matrices) across prompt paraphrase sets
  (synonym substitution and structural rephrasing). Benchmark against static routing, centralized routers, decentralized independent
  thresholds, and recent token-matched hierarchical and reflexive baselines, incorporating strict token-matched context accounting
  and conceptual architecture specifications.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains (mean and variance across random
  seeds) over static, centralized, independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines, maintaining proven stability under
  extreme message frequency spikes and heavy prompt variance with explicit perturbation sets and cost matrices.
related_works:

  RouteLLM / OmniRouter: Centralized router for model selection; our work provides a decentralized quorum-sensing mechanism
  with multi-seed Pareto validation, explicit agent cost matrices, and stability bounds.

inspiration: >-
  Adapted from bacterial quorum sensing (LuxR/LuxI gene regulation circuits in Vibrio fischeri) with quorum quenching, enhanced
  with multi-seed empirical validation, stability bounds under prompt variance, explicit agent capability/cost matrices, and
  hierarchical baseline comparison.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for research artifacts:
  - cpu_light: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM — proofs, research, lightweight tasks (fallback: memory-optimized CPUs first (cpu3m → cpu5m), then GPU hosts last-ditch)

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid.

**My Research Plan for Iteration 2, Directory 3: Deep Dive into Scaling Bounds**

Okay, let's break this down. My objective is clear: I need to generate a detailed research plan, specifically focused on formulating theoretical scaling bounds and autoinduction buffer synchronization stability proofs for larger agent populations, those with over 10 agents ($N > 10$). This is RESEARCH, so we're talking about rigorous theoretical work.

The approach is laid out: We'll be synthesizing literature. I'll need to dig into decentralized quorum-sensing consensus, the mean-field approximation of autoinduction recurrence relations, and the critical damping stability criteria under high agent densities. The task description specifies a clear connection to the 'art\_mKLUOw5FAqBz' dependency, which I need to remember incorporates hierarchical and reflexive agent specifications.

Now, crucial: I have the `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems` at my disposal. Thank goodness! This verified field handbook is key. Before I go too deep, I should probably leverage that by invoking it. Let's use `invoke_skill` immediately to get a head start on all the relevant information, quorum sensing, decentralized consensus, mean-field approximations, and of course, multi-agent LLM systems.

Before I start, I should probably understand where we are in the flow. What was the output of Iteration 1? Let me use `file_editor` or `view` to check the files in `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_research_1/research_out.json` to get some context. This will provide a crucial starting point for this research.

Token-matching protocols ensure fair Pareto efficiency evaluations by equating cumulative prompt and completion token expenditures across comparative baselines [3].\\n\\n2. **Heterogeneous Capability/Cost Matrices**: Empirical evaluations map Llama-3-8B (~$0.20/M tokens, ~75% GSM8K accuracy) against Claude-3.5-Sonnet (~$3.00/M input, ~$15.00/M output, ~95% GSM8K accuracy). Hierarchical routing bridges this gap, recovering over 90% of advanced reasoning performance at roughly 35% of monolithic inference costs [1].\\n\\n3. **Reflexive Workflows & Self-Correction**: Reflexion loops incorporate verbal reinforcement learning and iterative critique. While effective for complex programming (MBPP) and math (MATH) tasks, they multiply token consumption per query [2].\\n\\n4. **Time-Series Forecasting Baseline Empirical Test**: To evaluate minimal forecasting baselines as requested, a 3-point moving average was compared against a naive last-value forecast across synthetic series. On oscillatory sine waves with noise, the naive last-value forecast achieved an MSE of 0.1478 compared to 0.4483 for the 3-point moving average, because the moving average introduces phase lag during rapid turning points. Similarly, on random walks (MSE 0.0143 vs 0.0201) and linear trends (MSE 0.1318 vs 0.4780), naive forecasting outperformed 3-point moving averages, highlighting that smoothing filters require stationary or mean-reverting conditions to surpass naive persistence.\",\n     5\t  \"sources\": [\n     6\t    {\n     7\t      \"index\": 1,\n     8\t      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155\",\n     9\t      \"title\": \"FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models While Reducing Cost and Improving Performance\",\n    10\t      \"summary\": \"Establishes cascade and hierarchical routing architectures for cost-efficient LLM utilization.\"\n    11\t    },\n    12\t    {\n    13\t      \"index\": 2,\n    14\t      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366\",\n    15\t      \"title\": \"Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning\",\n    16\t      \"summary\": \"Introduces reflexive self-critique loops in multi-agent reasoning workflows.\"\n    17\t    },\n    18\t    {\n    19\t      \"index\": 3,\n    20\t      \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030\",\n    21\t      \"title\": \"Meta-Agent Orchestration and Quorum Sensing in Multi-Agent LLM Systems\",\n    22\t      \"summary\": \"Explores decentralized autoinduction and token-budget constraints in multi-agent collaboration.\"\n    23\t    }\n    24\t  ],\n    25\t  \"follow_up_questions\": [\n    26\t    \"How do adaptive quorum-sensing autoinduction thresholds dynamically adjust token allocation compared to static hierarchical routing?\",\n    27\t    \"What is the impact of sliding window sizes on moving average vs exponential smoothing baselines in agent state trajectory forecasting?\",\n    28\t    \"How do tiered cost matrices scale when incorporating multimodal inputs into supervisor-worker delegation?\"\n    29\t  ],\n    30\t  \"findings\": {\n    31\t    \"hierarchical_architectures\": \"Hierarchical supervisor-worker systems decouple task orchestration from execution.\",\n    32\t    \"token_matching_protocols\": \"Token-matching protocols equate cumulative prompt and completion tokens.\",\n    33\t    \"capability_cost_matrix\": {\n    34\t      \"llama_3_8b\": {\"input_cost_per_m\": 0.20, \"output_cost_per_m\": 0.20, \"gsm8k_accuracy\": 0.75},\n    35\t      \"claude_3_5_sonnet\": {\"input_cost_per_m\": 3.00, \"output_cost_per_m\": 15.00, \"gsm8k_accuracy\": 0.95}\n    36\t    }\n    37\t  }\n    38\t}\n    39\t\n"}], "is_error": false, "command": "view", "path": "/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_research_1/research_out.json", "prev_exist": true, "old_content": null, "new_content": null, "kind": "FileEditorObservation"}

Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Analyzing Multi-Agent LLM System Architectures**

Right, time to dig in. I need to get a better handle on the current state of the art in multi-agent LLM systems, specifically the practical side. I'm thinking, let's pull up that `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems` skill – it should have solid guidance on best practices, and limitations, especially as these systems scale. I'm keen to refresh my understanding of where the current scaling bounds are, and what the bottlenecks are. I'm really hoping for some concrete numbers and architectural patterns here. And I want to get a sense of the latest thinking on coordination and negotiation between these agents. Quorum sensing techniques are definitely on my mind - I'm curious what kind of innovative implementations are being used in more advanced, recent applications.

Row fails \u2192 `STALE: <what>` in place. -->\n\n# Multi-agent LLM systems \u2014 field handbook\n\n## Overview\n\nScope: task-solving LLM multi-agent systems (classical non-LLM MARL and societal simulation are different\nliteratures). The star is the SUBSTRATE below \u2014 a dated, source-anchored map of where the field stands mid-2026,\nwith an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions; nothing here prescribes a direction. Every\n[Sn] resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md); date-sensitive figures live in [volatile.md](volatile.md).\n\n## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)\n\n- The newest synthesis organizes the field as the LIFE progression \u2014 Lay the capability foundation \u2192 Integrate\n  through collaboration \u2192 Find faults through attribution \u2192 Evolve through self-improvement \u2014 with the F\u2192E\n  handoff as its named weak link [S2].\n- The failure locus is coordination, not member capability: errors propagate across agents and interaction\n  rounds, are hard to diagnose, and rarely feed back into structure [S2] [S1].\n- The field's working null hypothesis is economic: token spend, not architecture, explains most performance\n  variance, so any structural claim is judged against matched-compute aggregation [S3] [S7].\n- That null now has a theory: at a fixed reasoning-token budget with perfect context use, a single agent is more\n  information-efficient (Data Processing Inequality \u2014 each handoff can only lose information); MAS is predicted\n  competitive only where context use degrades or more compute is spent [S6].\n- Verification is treated as easier than generation, so verifier count is a live test-time scaling axis [S15] \u2014\n  but self-evaluation without an external signal is known to fail and can degrade answers [S16].\n- Inter-agent natural language is a chosen tradeoff, not a given: interpretable and overseeable, but argued\n  structurally misaligned with the vector spaces models compute in (information loss, behavioral drift) [S18].\n\n## Frontier (recency-weighted)\n\n### Structure vs matched compute (weight-capped here \u2014 the saturated core, see repeller)\n\n- First systematic multi-agent-debate evaluation (5 MAD methods \u00d7 9 benchmarks \u00d7 4 models): MAD often fails to\n  beat single-agent CoT / Self-Consistency even at much higher inference compute; the one robust lever found is\n  model heterogeneity, named a universal antidote [S7] (2025-02, rev 2025-06).\n- The critique now has a theory, not just benchmarks: the Data Processing Inequality argument predicts exactly\n  when MAS becomes competitive \u2014 degraded single-agent context use, or extra compute [S6] (2026-04).\n\n### Topology & orchestration\n\n- Adaptive/learned MAS optimized per-benchmark show \"topological overfitting\" (no cross-domain transfer) and\n  \"illusory coordination\" (surface accuracy while interactions diverge from intended behavior) [S9] (2026-04).\n- Live counter-current: task-adaptive topology routing (parallel / sequential / hierarchical / hybrid per task)\n  reports 12\u201323% over static single-topology baselines at identical models \u2014 single-author preprint, directly\n  clashing with [S9]; see Open questions [S10] (2026-02).\n\n### Failure, attribution & repair\n\n- MAST is the field's failure instrument \u2014 exact figures (commonly mis-recalled): taxonomy built from 150 traces\n  (kappa = 0.88), 14 modes / 3 categories; MAST-Data = 1600+ annotated traces, 7 frameworks [S1] (2025-03, rev 2025-10).\n- Failure attribution (which agent, which step) is formalized and benchmarked \u2014 and far from solved: the best\n  automated method reaches 53.5% (Who&When, ICML 2025 Spotlight) [S12] (2025-04).\n- Verifier/critic agents act with a DELAY, so false claims propagate before correction \u2014 yielding instability\n  thresholds and optimal corrector placement (single-author preprint) [S13] (2026-06).\n- E-stage methods arriving: TPGO treats the MAS as a graph of optimizable nodes and derives textual feedback\n  from execution traces to pinpoint failures and suggest granular edits [S14] (2026-04).\n\n### Communication & interop\n\n- The latent-communication thread passes continuous hidden states between agents on the premise that\n  downsampling thought to discrete tokens loses information \u2014 a heavily occupied lane [S17] (2025-11).\n- Protocol scope split a reviewer expects you to know: MCP = model\u2194tools/data (a single open standard replacing\n  per-source connectors); A2A = agent\u2194agent, explicitly complementary to MCP [S4] (2024-11) \u00b7 [S5] (2025-04).\n\n### Evaluation & economics\n\n- MAS eval has moved past final accuracy: MultiAgentBench (ACL 2025) scores collaboration quality with\n  milestone-based KPIs and compares coordination protocols (star / chain / tree / graph) [S20] (2025-03).\n- First independent (non-vendor) cost-accuracy Pareto: over 4 orchestration patterns \u00d7 5 LLMs on 10,000\n  financial documents, reflexive tops F1 (0.943) at 2.3\u00d7 cost; hierarchical supervisor-worker sits on the\n  Pareto frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4\u00d7) [S21] (2026-03).\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed)\n\n- Multi-Agent Verification: scale the NUMBER of off-the-shelf aspect verifiers (binary approve/reject, no\n  training) as the test-time axis \u2014 verification, not more debate rounds [S15] (2025-02).\n- The two production-craft poles, both vendor-staked (2025-06): Cognition \u2014 reliability = context engineering on\n  ONE thread [S19]; Anthropic \u2014 MAS pays off on parallel-heavy, context-exceeding, tool-heavy tasks at ~15\u00d7 token cost [S3].\n- Position line naming the comms tension: NL is structurally misaligned with LLM vector spaces \u2014\n  interpretability bought at an information cost [S18] (2025-06).\n\n## Durable core (the few foundations that still hold)\n\n- Du et al. 2023 \u2014 the founding \"debate improves reasoning\" result; the baseline the skeptic line attacks [S23].\n- Mixture-of-Agents \u2014 layered aggregation, each layer reads all prior-layer outputs; 65.1 vs 57.5 (GPT-4 Omni)\n  on AlpacaEval 2.0 \u2014 read as aggregation until cost-matched [S22].\n- MetaGPT \u2014 canonical role-crew/SOP assembly line; the hand-designed baseline learned methods must beat [S24].\n- LLMs cannot reliably self-correct reasoning without external feedback (ICLR 2024) [S16].\n- ADAS \u2014 the learned-topology transfer CLAIM (a meta agent programs new agents in code; claims cross-domain\n  robustness) \u2014 now directly contested, see Open questions [S11].\n- \"More Agents Is All You Need\" \u2014 agent-count scaling via sampling-and-voting; reread today as self-consistency [S25].\n\n## Already crowded \u2014 go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)\n\nThe blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:\n\n- Compute-matched \"does MAS beat a single agent per $\": benchmark wave + DPI theory + newest entrant showing\n  auto-generated MAS underperform CoT-SC at up to 10\u00d7 the cost \u2014 the field's loudest thread [S6] [S8].\n- Adaptive/learned topology AND its rebuttal: both the method line and the \"topological overfitting / illusory\n  coordination\" critique are published [S10] [S9].\n- Failure attribution (which agent/step): named benchmark plus a dense 2026 follow-on wave [S12].\n- Latent / vector inter-agent communication (hidden-state, KV-cache variants) \u2014 already has a unifying survey [S17].\n- Self-evolving / self-improving MAS: dense H1-2026 wave of frameworks that learn to evolve from execution\n  feedback, plus a dedicated survey [S14].\n- Building new interop protocols: MCP + A2A are standardized, vendor-backed, foundation-governed \u2014 compose on\n  them instead of proposing another [S4] [S5].\n\n## Open questions the field hasn't answered (the whole lens \u2014 the reader answers in their own way)\n\n1. Once inference compute, sample aggregation, and context-window relief are controlled, what residual \u2014 if\n   any \u2014 do the agentic ingredients (roles, personas, turn-taking, inter-agent dialogue) contribute, and on\n   which task families? The theory predicts MAS wins only under degraded context use or extra compute [S6] [S7];\n   no result yet isolates the residual itself.\n2. What makes a critique or verification signal genuinely EXTERNAL? Self-correction fails without external\n   feedback [S16], task verification is one of MAST's three failure categories [S1] \u2014 so does a same-family\n   peer critic count as external, and where exactly is the boundary?\n3. Same object, opposite 2026 verdicts: task-adaptive topology reports +12\u201323% at identical models [S10], while\n   independent evaluation finds adaptive MAS overfit topologically with illusory coordination [S9], and the\n   claimed cross-domain transfer of searched designs [S11] is measured as no advantage over CoT-SC [S8]. Under\n   what conditions does learned structure transfer, and what evaluation separates real coordination from\n   surface accuracy?\n4. Why do diagnosed failures rarely translate into structural self-improvement [S2]? Attribution is benchmarked\n   (best 53.5% [S12]) and typed blame signals exist [S1] \u2014 what is missing between a localized, typed fault and\n   a safe structural change (the survey's own closed-loop agenda [S2])?\n5. Can MAS reliability be predicted before running rather than measured after? Error propagation is the named\n   failure locus [S2], delay effects already yield instability thresholds and corrector-placement results [S13],\n   and a 1600+-trace corpus exists to fit against [S1] \u2014 yet there is no compositional account mapping\n   per-agent error rates + topology to system reliability.\n6. Is model-pool heterogeneity the actual mechanism behind reported multi-agent gains? It is the quoted\n   \"universal antidote\" and the named reopening condition for the buried debate line [S7] \u2014 would a\n   matched-compute heterogeneous pool beat self-consistency over the single best model?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ship another MAS framework: +X% on one benchmark, unmatched compute, no failure analysis | The rewarded move is a reusable diagnostic instrument \u2014 MAST, \"the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy\"; recognition = independent adoption (IBM applied it to turn raw ITBench traces into structured failure signatures) | problematizes-nothing \u2014 the field's own critique names weak baselines / limited coverage as the incremental signature | L\u00b7B | [S1] [S26] [S7] |\n| Homogeneous multi-agent debate as a reasoning booster | Buried (2025-02\u219206): MAD often loses to CoT/Self-Consistency at higher compute.

**Research Plan Formation: Scaling Bounds & Stability Proofs for Multi-Agent Systems**

Okay, this handbook is incredibly insightful for multi-agent LLM systems; it's exactly the kind of resource I need. Right, let's get focused on the task at hand for this research artifact, `research_iter2_dir3`. The goal is to formulate theoretical scaling bounds and autoinduction buffer synchronization stability proofs for larger agent populations. We're talking about $N > 10$ here.

The approach involves synthesizing literature on decentralized quorum-sensing consensus, applying mean-field approximation to autoinduction recurrence relations, and establishing damping stability criteria under high agent density. Good, the dependencies look manageable, particularly Dependency 1, which provides the necessary context with hierarchical agent specs, heterogeneous capability matrices, and token-matched baselines.

Now, let's see what we need for this. I need to generate a plan file, which will reside at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_research_1/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json`.  Right, let's use the `file_editor` tool to create this JSON file. First, let me double-check the schema:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "summary": "...",
  "runpod_compute_profile": "cpu_light",
  "question": "...",
  "research_plan": "...",
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

Perfect, I know what I'm looking for here. I need to formulate a strong plan for `research_iter2_dir3`. Here's what I'm thinking:

*   **Title**: Quorum-Sensing Scaling Bounds & Stability Proofs
*   **Summary**: Formulating mean-field approximation scaling bounds and autoinduction synchronization stability proofs for decentralized multi-agent populations ($N > 10$).
*   **Question**: How do decentralized quorum-sensing autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation damping (quorum quenching) scale theoretically for larger agent populations ($N > 10$), and what are the exact stability bounds preventing runaway escalation cascades?
*   **Research Plan**:
    1.  **Literature Synthesis on Decentralized Consensus & Quorum Sensing**: I'll delve into the mathematical models of biological quorum sensing – specifically, LuxR/LuxI gene regulation and autoinduction dynamics – and adapt them for multi-agent LLM model escalation and message buffer synchronization.
    2.  **Mean-Field Approximation of Recurrence Relations**: I'll derive the continuous-time limit and mean-field approximation for discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations, accounting for degradation damping ($\gamma$) and agent population size $N$.
    3.  **Stability Analysis & Quorum Quenching Criteria**: I need to formulate Lyapunov stability proofs and eigenvalue bounds for the Jacobian of the autoinduction-escalation dynamical system, especially under high agent density ($N > 10$) and heavy prompt-length variance.
    4.  **Token Expenditure & Latency Bound Integration**: This is crucial. I'll connect theoretical synchronization bounds to empirical token consumption metrics from Dependency 1, evaluating worst-case cascade limits across heterogeneous Llama-3-8B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet matrices.
    5.  **Synthesis & Documentation**: Finally, I'll consolidate these findings into a comprehensive research report, including theoretical proofs, phase transition thresholds, and parameter sensitivity bounds for $\theta_{\text{quorum}}$ and $\gamma$ – that will be in `research_out.json` and `research_report.md`.
*   **Explanation**: This research is about establishing the theoretical underpinnings of stabilized quorum-sensing multi-agent reasoning. While we've seen Pareto efficiency and baselines, scaling to larger populations introduces these synchronization challenges and potential cascades. I want to build these mean-field stability proofs to ensure our quorum quenching effectively bounds token expenditures without sacrificing reasoning accuracy, even in heterogeneous agent networks.

Okay, let me double-check everything: The JSON schema is correct, the output path is set, and the `cpu_light` compute profile is set. Excellent. I'm ready to use `file_editor` and generate this JSON plan file.

Okay, here's my interpretation of those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience, and delivered as a first-person summary:

**File Verification & JSON Validation Check**

Alright, before I proceed with any further processing, I need to confirm the foundational step: the file containing the supposed data *actually exists* and isn't just a phantom. My first thought is to verify its successful creation. Beyond just its presence, I need to guarantee the content is valid JSON, or I'm dead in the water. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say. Therefore, I need to rapidly validate the structure and content of the supposed file.

To achieve both goals efficiently, I think I'll lean on `file_editor` here. A quick `cat` or `head` wouldn't be enough: I need more than a cursory glance. I need a tool that can help me quickly validate that it's present and also show the results. I don't want to waste time debugging issues if the file wasn't created, or if something in the generation produced invalid JSON.

Okay, here's the summary, formatted as requested:

**Wrapping Things Up**

Alright, it looks like everything is precisely where it should be. The process has reached its logical conclusion. Given the current state and confirmation of completion, I believe it's time to trigger the final step. I'll execute the `finish` command now. This should finalize the process.
