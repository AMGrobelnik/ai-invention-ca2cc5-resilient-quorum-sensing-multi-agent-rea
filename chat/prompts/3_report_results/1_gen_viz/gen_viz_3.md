Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_om2tRiXGCTOe/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_3`

<task>
Render a publication-quality DATA figure for a top-tier venue research paper.

This figure plots numbers, so it is RENDERED from those numbers — not drawn by an image model. Use the aii-data-fig-gen skill. The output is deterministic: run it once, look at it, fix the spec if the data or labels are wrong, run it again.

STEPS:
1. Read the skill: `.claude/skills/aii-data-fig-gen/SKILL.md`.
2. Pick the chart type that fits the specification below. `python <skill>/scripts/chart_gen.py --list-types` lists them; `--example <type>` prints a complete spec to copy.
3. Write your spec to `fig3_spec.json` in your workspace. Put EVERY numeric value from the specification into it — the spec is the figure.
4. Render it:
   `python <skill>/scripts/chart_gen.py --spec fig3_spec.json --out fig3_v0`
   That writes `fig3_v0.pdf` (the deliverable, vector) and `fig3_v0.png` (for you to look at).
5. READ THE PNG BACK and check it against the checklist below.
6. If anything is wrong, edit the spec and re-render. Repeat until clean — this is cheap and deterministic, so there is no attempt limit and no reason to accept a flawed figure.

DELIVERABLE: `fig3_v0.pdf` in your workspace root. Leave `fig3_spec.json` there too — it is the figure's source, and the step files it next to the figure so the figure stays reproducible.

Verification checklist (after EVERY render):
- Every number in the figure matches the specification — no invented or dropped values
- Axis labels state what is measured AND its units
- Every series appears in the legend, and the legend does not cover any data
- Category / tick labels do not overlap or run off the edge (widen `aspect` to "21:9", or split into a `panel`, if they do)
- Axis ranges make the comparison readable rather than flattening it
- The caption describes what is actually drawn

Reach for a generator first, and hand-write only if none fits. Every type in `--list-types` already carries the house style, the data-integrity checks and the layout fixes, so using one is less work than plotting by hand and the result matches every other figure in the paper.

If nothing in the catalogue fits, writing matplotlib yourself is expected and supported — novel figures exist. When you do, import the house style so the figure still belongs to the set (`from chart_style import apply_house_style, PALETTE, literal, fit_titles`; see the "Use a generator when one fits" section of SKILL.md for the pattern). What you lose is the automatic checking that the picture agrees with the numbers, so verify every value yourself against the specification.

# Data figures — charts rendered from their numbers

Deterministic figures from a JSON spec: the numbers go in, matplotlib draws
them, and the picture cannot disagree with the data. Nothing is generated by
a model, so a bar is the height of its value and every axis is computed.
Re-running a spec gives a byte-identical PNG; the PDF differs only in its
embedded creation timestamp.

## Data figure or concept figure?

| The figure is… | Use |
|---|---|
| A chart of numbers you have | **this skill** (data figure) |
| A confusion matrix, ablation grid, correlation | **this skill** (data figure) |
| A scaling law, training curve, Pareto trade-off | **this skill** (data figure) |
| Conceptual artwork, a metaphor, a cover image | `aii-concept-fig-gen` (concept figure) |
| An architecture or flow diagram | `aii-concept-fig-gen` (concept figure — see *Limits*) |

The test is whether the figure has underlying numbers. If it does, an image
model will approximate them — bars that do not match their labels, axis
ticks that do not divide evenly, invented data points. That failure is
invisible to a reviewer of the prompt and obvious to a reviewer of the
paper.

## Use a generator when one fits — hand-write only when none does

The generators are a menu, not a fence. Every type below is a shortcut that
already has the house style, the data-integrity guards and the layout fixes
baked in, so reaching for one is almost always less work than plotting by
hand and the result is consistent with every other figure in the paper.

**Check `--list-types` first.** If a type matches what you need, use it.
Two-thirds of research figures are a bar, a line, a scatter or a heatmap,
and those are solved.

**If nothing fits, write matplotlib yourself** — that is expected and
supported, not a failure. Novel or one-off figures exist. When you do:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<skill>/scripts")
from chart_style import apply_house_style, PALETTE, literal, fit_titles

apply_house_style()                 # fonts, palette, grid, Type-42 PDF fonts
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3.94), layout="constrained")
...
fit_titles(fig)                     # wrap any title wider than its axes
fig.savefig("figX_v0.pdf")          # vector, so LaTeX renders text at page res
```

That keeps a hand-written figure looking like the rest of the paper and
still gets you colourblind-safe colours, submission-compliant fonts, and no
clipped labels. What you lose is the data-integrity checking — so verify
the numbers yourself.

**If you hand-write the same figure type twice, add a renderer instead.**
`chart_renderers*.py` — one function, `(ax, spec) -> None`, registered in
its family's dict. That is how this catalogue got here.

## Use it

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-data-fig-gen"
G="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/chart_gen.py"

python "$G" --list-types            # the catalogue
python "$G" --example bar           # a complete spec to copy and edit
python "$G" --spec fig1.json --out figures/fig1
```

Writes `figures/fig1.pdf` **and** `figures/fig1.png`. The PDF is the
deliverable — LaTeX renders vector text at page resolution, so it stays
sharp and selectable at any zoom. The PNG exists so you can read the figure
back and look at it.

`--format pdf`, `--format png`, `--format pdf,png,svg` narrows the output.
`--spec -` reads the spec from stdin.

Runs on `matplotlib` + `numpy`, both already `aii_pipeline` dependencies —
nothing to install.

## The catalogue

`--example <type>` prints a complete spec for any of these. The "instead of"
column is the useful one: most figures have two plausible types and the
choice between them is what decides whether a reviewer reads the point.

### Comparing categories

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `bar` | Vertical bars, grouped or stacked, optional error bars. | The default. `barh` if names are long. |
| `barh` | Horizontal bars — labels on the y-axis with room to run. | `bar`, whenever names exceed ~40 chars, or for a ranking. |
| `lollipop` | A stem and a dot per category. | `barh`, past ~20 categories, where bars become a picket fence. |
| `dumbbell` | Two markers per row joined by a line. | Paired bars, when the GAP between them is the story. |
| `slope` | One line per item from a before value to an after value. | Paired bars, when which items changed RANK is the story. |
| `diverging` | Signed bars either side of zero, sorted. | `bar`, for deltas — direction reads instantly. |
| `waterfall` | Steps from a starting total to a final total. | `bar`, for an ablation — it shows contributions compounding. |
| `bar_sig` | Grouped bars with significance brackets and stars. | `bar`, when the comparison being claimed is pairwise. |
| `forest` | Point estimates with confidence intervals and a null line. | `bar`, when whether an interval crosses zero is the question. |
| `radar` | A closed polygon per method over 3+ metrics. | Several bar charts, for a multi-metric profile at a glance. |
| `parallel` | One polyline per configuration across independently scaled axes. | A table, for a hyperparameter sweep — trends across axes show up. |
| `funnel` | Stage attrition with retention vs. previous and vs. intake. | `barh`, when the stages are sequential and losses compound. |
| `stacked_pct` | Composition as percentages; every bar full height. | Stacked `bar`, when categories have very different totals. |
| `treemap` | Nested rectangles with AREA proportional to value. | `bar`, only when there are too many parts for one axis — length beats area for precise reading. |
| `upset` | Set intersections as sorted bars over a membership matrix. | A Venn diagram, past 3 sets — circles cannot stay area-true and stop reading as sets. |

### Trends and relationships

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `line` | Multi-series lines with optional uncertainty bands. | The default for anything against time or steps. |
| `step` | A piecewise-constant series — value holds, then jumps. | `line`, for schedules — a slope implies values that never occurred. |
| `scatter` | Points with an optional least-squares fit and R². | `line`, when x is not ordered and the relationship is the point. |
| `bubble` | Scatter with a third variable as marker AREA, plus a size key. | `scatter`, when a third quantity matters but not enough for its own axis. |
| `scaling` | Log-log points with a fitted power law and its exponent. | `line`, for scaling laws — the exponent is computed and annotated. |
| `speedup` | Measured speedup against worker count, with the ideal line. | `line`, for parallel results — the ideal reference is what the claim is measured against. |
| `pareto` | Scatter with the non-dominated frontier drawn through it. | `scatter`, for trade-offs where the frontier is the finding. |
| `area` | Stacked areas — a total and how it divides. | `line`, when the total matters as much as the parts. |
| `residual` | Residuals against fitted values, with the zero line. | Predicted-vs-actual, where heteroscedasticity hides on the diagonal. |
| `bland_altman` | Difference between two methods against their mean, with limits of agreement. | A scatter of A against B, where the diagonal reads as agreement and r = 0.99 hides a 10% offset. |
| `acf` | Autocorrelation per lag as stems, with the significance band. | `line`, which shows the level and hides whether each point predicts the next. |
| `sankey` | Flows between stages at proportional widths. | `area`, when what matters is what became what. |
| `timeline` | Gantt-style spans, one row per task. | A table of timestamps, when overlap and duration are the point. |

### Model evaluation

Give these raw `labels` and `scores` rather than a precomputed curve wherever
you can: the renderer sweeps the threshold itself, so the AUC or AP in the
legend is integrated from the points actually drawn and cannot drift from
the curve beside it.

When only the curve survives — it came from a paper, or from a logged
artefact — pass it directly instead: `fpr`/`tpr` for `roc`, `recall`/
`precision` for `pr`, `probabilities`/`labels` for `calibration`. The
summary statistic is still integrated from the plotted points, so a PR curve
that stops short reports `AP = 0.375 up to recall 0.60` rather than quietly
extrapolating the rest. One evaluation set per figure: `pr`'s baseline and
`calibration`'s bins both move with class balance, so curves from different
test sets cannot share axes honestly.

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `roc` | ROC curves with AUC in the legend, plus the chance diagonal. | `pr`, when the classes are roughly balanced. |
| `pr` | Precision-recall curves with average precision and the prevalence baseline. | `roc`, when positives are rare — ROC flatters a rare-class model. |
| `calibration` | Reliability diagram with the ideal diagonal, ECE, and per-bin counts. | `roc`/`pr`, when whether to TRUST a probability is the question. |
| `learning_curve` | Score against training-set size, train and validation with ±std bands. | `line`, to show whether more data or a better model is the bottleneck. |
| `qq` | Sample quantiles against theoretical normal quantiles, with a reference line. | `hist`, for judging normality — the eye reads a straight line far better than a bell. |
| `cd_diagram` | Mean ranks over many datasets, joining methods a test cannot separate. | `bar_sig`, which compares pairwise on ONE dataset — this is the many-datasets headline figure. |

### Distributions

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `box` | Median, quartiles, whiskers, outliers per group. | The compact default for a few groups. |
| `violin` | Full mirrored density per group. | `box`, when a distribution may be multi-modal — a box hides that. |
| `strip` | Every raw observation, jittered, with the mean marked. | `box`, when n is small enough that each point should be visible. |
| `ridgeline` | Stacked density curves, one row per group. | `violin`, past ~6 groups, where a violin grid gets too wide. |
| `raincloud` | Half violin, box and jittered points together, with n. | `violin`, when the reader must see the observations — twelve seeds look as smooth as twelve thousand. |
| `hist` | Binned counts or density. | `ecdf`, only when the shape of ONE distribution is the point. |
| `ecdf` | Empirical cumulative distribution, stepped. | `hist`, for comparing distributions — no bin width to argue about. |
| `survival` | Kaplan-Meier curves with censoring ticks and confidence bands. | `ecdf`, when some subjects have not finished — an ECDF must drop or invent those. |
| `hexbin` | Hexagonal density bins with a colourbar. | `scatter`, past ~2000 points where it becomes a solid blob. |
| `hist2d` | A joint distribution as a rectangular binned grid. | `hexbin`, when the axes are naturally rectangular. |

### Matrices and fields

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `heatmap` | Annotated matrix with a colourbar. | A table, when the pattern matters more than the digits. |
| `corr` | Correlation matrix, diverging map centred at zero. | `heatmap`, for correlations — sign reads from colour direction. |
| `contour` | Filled contours of a 2-D field, levels labelled. | `heatmap`, for a smooth field like a loss surface. |

### Composites

| type | draws | choose it over |
|---|---|---|
| `panel` | Any of the above in a lettered grid, `(a)`–`(p)`. | Several separate figures, when they are read together. |

## Spec shape

```json
{
  "type": "bar",
  "title": "Accuracy by benchmark",
  "xlabel": "Benchmark",
  "ylabel": "Accuracy (%)",
  "aspect": "16:9",
  "categories": ["ARC", "GSM8K", "HumanEval"],
  "series": [
    {"label": "Baseline", "values": [41.2, 55.8, 33.1], "errors": [1.8, 2.4, 2.9]},
    {"label": "Ours",     "values": [48.9, 67.3, 45.6], "errors": [1.5, 2.0, 2.6]}
  ]
}
```

Shared keys on every type: `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `aspect` (`"W:H"`),
`width_in` (default 7.0 — a full text-width figure), `xlim`, `ylim`,
`font_pt`, `font_family`, `legend_loc`.

`font_family` puts one font ahead of the default stack. Needed only for a
script the default cannot draw — CJK, Devanagari, Thai. See *Legibility*.

Per-type keys are documented by `--example <type>`; start from the example
rather than the schema.

### Multi-panel

```json
{"type": "panel", "title": "Overview", "ncols": 2, "panels": [ {...}, {...} ]}
```

Any chart type nests inside `panels`. Sub-panels are lettered `(a)`, `(b)`…
automatically — do not put the letter in the panel's own `title`, which is
how panel labels end up collided with their titles.

## It refuses rather than lying

The generator exits non-zero, writing nothing, when the figure would not
match its data. These were live defects, each of which exited 0 and produced
a confident, plausible, wrong picture:

- **Length mismatches.** Five categories against three values used to render
  three bars and silently drop two categories. Ragged series were zero-filled,
  inventing measurements nobody made.
- **NaN / Infinity / null / strings in values.** matplotlib draws NaN as
  *nothing*, so the gap reads as a measured zero.
- **Glyphs the font cannot draw.** A missing glyph renders as a hollow box
  and matplotlib only warns. It is machine-dependent too: CJK looks right on
  a laptop with a CJK font and ships as boxes from the pipeline image.

Errors name the offending key and index (`series[1].values has 2 entries but
5 were expected`), so a bad spec is one edit from correct. Nothing partial is
ever written — a half-file would pass the downstream existence check.

## Legibility

- **Non-Latin scripts.** The default font covers Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and
  Hebrew. For anything else set `font_family` (e.g. `"Noto Sans CJK JP"`) —
  matplotlib uses the *first* resolvable family and does no per-glyph
  fallback, so the covering font has to go first. Without it the figure is
  refused rather than shipped full of boxes.
- **Dense categories.** Labels wrap when long, tilt at 30° when that isn't
  enough, and go vertical past ~12 — at 90° they cannot collide however long
  they get. Names past ~40 characters do not fit under a vertical bar at all
  and are refused with a pointer to `barh`, which puts the label on the
  y-axis where the full width is available.
- **Many series.** Past eight the palette wraps, so the line style becomes a
  second channel — otherwise series 1 and 9 were the same colour. Past six,
  the legend moves below the axes. Inside, it
  covered the data at twelve series and hid a tick label; outside, layout
  reserves real space for it.
- **Long titles** are measured after layout and wrapped. On a chart whose
  axes is a narrow strip (a `barh` with long names) the title is promoted to
  a figure heading, since an axes title would centre on the strip and run
  off the page.
- **`$` is safe.** A matched pair used to be read as mathtext, so
  "Cost $5 to $9" rendered as "Cost 5to9". All user text is now escaped, so
  dollars print verbatim. The trade: mathtext is unavailable — write
  superscripts in Unicode (`R²`, `10⁻³`), which the fits already do.

## What the house style already handles

Do not re-solve these; they are set globally in `chart_style.py`.

- **Colourblind-safe palette** (Okabe-Ito) that also survives greyscale
  print. Never override it with a red/green pair.
- **Sans-serif**, sized for the figure's final print size.
- **No chartjunk** — no 3D, gradients, shadows, coloured plot background;
  faint horizontal grid behind the data only.
- **Constrained layout**, so an axis label can never be clipped off the
  canvas. This was the single most common defect across every library
  surveyed, including in otherwise flawless output. Layout alone does not
  cover TITLES — it reflows axes but cannot wrap a line — so titles wider
  than their axes are measured after layout and wrapped.
- **TrueType (Type 42) fonts, never Type 3.** matplotlib emits Type 3 by
  default and **IEEE and ACM submission systems reject PDFs containing
  it**, so every default matplotlib figure is non-compliant.
- **Legend headroom** — the y-range is widened before an inside legend is
  placed, because `loc="best"` lands on the data when nothing is free.
- **Sub-decade log axes keep their tick labels.** A log axis spanning less
  than one decade — a loss curve from 2.90 to 2.05, say — contains no power
  of ten. matplotlib ticks only at powers of ten, so it places 10⁰ and 10¹,
  *both outside the view*, and the visible axis carries no label at all.
  Silently. Handled.

## Verify what you generated

Read the PNG back and look at it. The generator prevents the structural
defects above, but it cannot know that your data was wrong. Check:

- every number in the figure matches the number you meant to plot;
- axis labels state units;
- no series is missing from the legend;
- category labels are not overlapping (pass a wider `aspect` if they are);
- the caption describes what is actually drawn.

If a figure is crowded, widen `aspect` (`"21:9"`) or split it into a
`panel` — do not shrink the font.

## Limits

- **Structural diagrams** (architecture, pipelines, DAGs, flowcharts) are
  out of scope. A survey found graphviz clearly best for these and worth
  ~7 MB in the image; it is not wired in, so those still go to
  `aii-concept-fig-gen`. Worth revisiting — a hero architecture diagram is
  exactly the figure an image model draws inconsistently.
- **No LaTeX-native output.** PGFPlots produces the best camera-ready
  result of anything surveyed, because the figure text is typeset by the
  paper's own engine in the paper's own font. It needs `texlive-pictures`,
  which `Dockerfile.pipeline` does not currently install (+81 MB).
- Chart types not covered: radar/spider, Sankey, geographic. Add a renderer
  to `chart_renderers.py` rather than hand-writing matplotlib at the call
  site — that is what keeps every figure in a paper looking like a set.
