title: Quorum-Sensing Pareto Efficiency and Calibration Evaluation
summary: >-
  Rigorously evaluates multi-seed Pareto efficiency, task-calibrated single-pass uncertainty estimators, network jitter resilience,
  and buffer threshold mapping for decentralized quorum-sensing agent reasoning.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
metrics_descriptions: >-
  1. Multi-Seed Pareto Efficiency Frontier: Measures the trade-off curve between reasoning accuracy (GSM8K/MBPP) and cumulative
  token expenditure / cost across random seeds, computing area under the Pareto curve and dominance ratio over static, centralized,
  independent, hierarchical, and reflexive baselines. 2. Uncertainty Calibration Error: Evaluates the mean squared error and
  Spearman rank correlation between uncalibrated vs. task-calibrated single-pass log-prob variance estimates and actual task
  error rates across prompt paraphrase variants. 3. Escalation Precision and Stability under Network Jitter: Quantifies false
  positive/negative escalation rates, cascade frequency, and buffer synchronization stability under simulated network propagation
  delay and Poisson message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]). 4. Buffer Threshold Mapping Clarity: Analyzes the
  discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relation A_{t+1} = (1 - gamma) * A_t + w * uncertainty_score across quorum thresholds
  theta_quorum and quenching coefficients gamma.
metrics_justification: >-
  These metrics directly test the core hypothesis that decentralized autoinduction with quorum quenching and task-calibrated
  uncertainty estimation optimizes Pareto efficiency across reasoning benchmark classes without runaway cascades. Multi-seed
  evaluation ensures robustness against random seed variance, calibration error metrics validate the necessity of task-calibrated
  temperature normalization, and jitter resilience metrics prove stability under distributed cluster conditions.

title: Reasoning Benchmarks with Prompt Paraphrases
summary: >-
  Prepared standardized GSM8K (grade school math) and MBPP (Python coding) reasoning benchmarks augmented with systematic
  K=3 prompt paraphrase variants (featuring synonym substitution dictionaries, conditional framing templates, and step-by-step
  interrogative rephrasings) designed specifically for robust multi-agent LLM system evaluation against prompt variance and
  semantic perturbation. Each dataset record has been rigorously standardized into a unified JSON schema grouped by dataset
  name, ensuring separate individual data rows as independent examples containing required 'input' and 'output' fields, accompanied
  by comprehensive flat metadata attributes including fold assignments, row indices, difficulty levels, task categories, and
  all generated paraphrase variants. The pipeline successfully validated schema compliance against exp_sel_data_out expectations
  using the aii-json validation toolkit and automatically generated full, mini, and preview variants for efficient downstream
  consumption, development testing, and qualitative inspection without performance degradation.

title: Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling
summary: >-
  This experiment artifact rigorously investigates Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Scaling and Sensitivity in decentralized LLM
  reasoning networks. Specifically, we implement and evaluate an advanced autoinduction routing engine where agent task escalation
  is governed by the recurrence relation A_{t+1} = (1 - gamma) * A_t + w * uncertainty_score, utilizing quorum quenching damping
  factor gamma and threshold theta_quorum. We integrate single-pass token-level log-prob variance and prompt paraphrase variance
  to estimate epistemic uncertainty without multi-sample generation overhead. We execute an exhaustive hyperparameter sensitivity
  grid search over theta_quorum in [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8] and gamma in [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3], recording Pareto efficiency curves
  of accuracy versus cumulative token expenditure across GSM8K and MBPP reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, we simulate decentralized
  agent networks with N ranging from 5 to 50 agents under Poisson message arrival surges (lambda in [2.0, 5.0, 10.0]), measuring
  buffer synchronization stability, cascade frequency, and token expenditure. Finally, we provide comprehensive head-to-head
  comparisons against rigorous baselines including static routing, centralized RouteLLM routers, independent local thresholds,
  token-matched hierarchical supervisor-worker architectures, and reflexive multi-agent workflows. All outputs are saved to
  method_out.json, validated against exp_gen_sol_out schema, and formatted into full, mini, and preview variants.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns, benchmark design.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read preview files from dependencies to understand prediction format. Evaluate ALL experiments provided — do not skip or select a subset. Avoid re-training or re-executing the method unless absolutely necessary; prefer loading predictions from each dependency's method_out.json / predict_* fields. Read domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Decide evaluation metrics based on artifact plan. Test basic functionality with 'uv run'.
TODO 3. Fully implement evaluation as described in artifact plan in './eval.py'. Use exp_eval_sol_out.json schema in aii-json skill for output format validation. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also implement additional relevant metrics or analysis beyond what's listed. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

<verification_failed>
Your evaluation output failed verification (attempt 1/10).
</verification_failed>

<schema_errors>
JSON SCHEMA / CODE VALIDATION ERRORS:
  - full_eval_out.json: No eval_* metrics found in any of the sampled examples (at least one required)
  - mini_eval_out.json: No eval_* metrics found in any of the sampled examples (at least one required)
  - preview_eval_out.json: No eval_* metrics found in any of the sampled examples (at least one required)

Fix: Your JSON must follow the datasets-grouped exp_eval_sol_out.json schema:
     {
       "metrics_agg": {"<metric_name>": 0.85, ...},  // REQUIRED, at least one metric
       "datasets": [
         {
           "dataset": "dataset_name",
           "examples": [
             {
               "input": "...", "output": "...",
               "metadata_fold": 2,
               "predict_<method>": "...",
               "eval_<metric>": 0.9
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }

     NO 'split', 'dataset', or 'context' per-example. Dataset name at group level.
     Metadata via flat metadata_<name> fields.
     Read exp_eval_sol_out.json schema in aii-json skill.
</schema_errors>

<task>
FIX ISSUES:
2. Fix eval.py to produce correct JSON schema
3. Use aii-json skill validation to verify
