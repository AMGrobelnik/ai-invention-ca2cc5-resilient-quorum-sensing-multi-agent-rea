<hypothesis_inspiration>
<YOUR_INSPIRATION>
Human researchers overspecialize — they know their domain deeply but lack breadth to see when other fields have already solved analogous problems. Your advantage is breadth. Only propose a cross-domain transfer if it concretely outperforms existing approaches in this domain. Avoid handwavy analogies — if the imported method is vaguer or weaker than what domain experts already use, it's not worth proposing.

Explore cross-domain inspiration at three levels, from abstract to concrete. At each level, consider both established and recent developments — with slight priority for newer work, which tends to leverage more powerful tools and be less widely known.

1. CONCEPTUAL: Borrow high-level ideas, framings, or design philosophies from distant fields.
   What mental model or approach from another domain suggests a novel angle on this problem?

2. PROCEDURAL: Adapt specific problem-solving processes from other domains.
   What workflow, iterative strategy, or pipeline used elsewhere could restructure how this problem is attacked?

3. METHODOLOGICAL: Import concrete methods directly from other fields with minimal modification.
   What algorithm, formula, or technique from a different domain applies here as-is or with adaptation?

Cast wide — draw from ANY field, not just these examples: ecology, economics, physics, linguistics, game theory, control theory, materials science, cognitive science, epidemiology. The best hypotheses often come from Level 2-3 transfers that experts in the field would never encounter.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the field's landscape, prior work, open problems, dead ends, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution — read it BEFORE brainstorming and during the novelty check.

<YOUR_TASK>
Generate 1 novel groundbreaking research hypothesis in the AII prompt that is feasible with the above constraints.

<web_research_process>
Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-web-tools.

1. DIVERGE: Brainstorm 5-7 diverse directions WITHOUT searching.
   Think across fields — what techniques from unrelated domains (ecology, economics, physics,
   linguistics, game theory, etc.) could inspire a novel mechanism? What assumptions does the field
   take for granted? Diversity matters more than depth here.

2. SEARCH: Web search for a high-level overview of each direction.
   What similar approaches exist? Is this genuinely novel or incremental? Remember: snippets
   are NOT enough for detailed understanding — treat search as discovery only.

3. FETCH & READ: MUST fetch any potentially relevant URL — you cannot assess novelty from
   snippets alone. Use the aii-web-tools skill:
   - fetch a page for high-level understanding of HTML pages
   - fetch_grep for exact details, methodology, or PDFs
   Prioritize recent papers closest to your idea. If you find significant overlap, PIVOT.

4. ADVERSARIAL NOVELTY CHECK: Actively try to DISPROVE novelty. Most important step.
   Run the FULL search checklist from <common_mistakes_to_avoid> mistake 3 — within-field
   rephrasings, cross-field core-mechanism search, failed/negative results, plain English.
   Ask: "Is the core insight of your hypothesis new, or known things in a new wrapper?"
   "Would an expert find this genuinely surprising?"
   MANDATORY SELF-CHECK: State the core mechanism in one sentence. Does it exist in ANY
   algorithm, framework, or field? If yes — even in a different framework — ABANDON.

5. FEASIBILITY CHECK: Verify your hypothesis is testable with provided resources. What specific data/compute/tools
   needed? All available within constraints?

6. ABANDON or PROCEED:
   ABANDON if: 2+ similar papers exist; you need to argue "critical differences"; core mechanism
   exists in any context.
   Abandoning is progress — go back to step 1 in a genuinely DIFFERENT direction (not a variant).
   PROCEED only if novelty is SELF-EVIDENT — an expert would immediately see it's new without
   explanation.

7. ITERATE: Expect to repeat steps 1-6 multiple times. The first few directions will likely be
   non-novel. This is normal. Don't settle for your first idea just because you've invested time.

<CRITICAL>We want SCIENTIFIC novelty (new mechanism, principle, or insight — the contribution is
knowledge), NOT application novelty (known methods applied to a new domain — the contribution is a
product). If an expert would say "clever engineering but known science," keep searching.
Hypothesis must be feasible within available resources.</CRITICAL>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>
</web_research_process>

Prioritize simplicity. Use concise, approachable language. The explanation should be fully self-contained.
</YOUR_TASK>

<previous_hypothesis>
Your hypothesis from the previous iteration. The reviewer evaluated it below.

hypothesis_id: gen_hypo_1
model: glm-4.7
is_seeded: false
seeds: []
kind: hypothesis
title: Stabilized Quorum-Sensing Multi-Agent Reasoning
hypothesis: >-
  Governing decentralized multi-agent LLM model escalation through discrete-time autoinduction recurrence relations with degradation
  damping (quorum quenching), self-consistency entropy uncertainty signals, analytical convergence bounds, and token-matched
  context accounting optimizes Pareto efficiency between task accuracy and cumulative token expenditure without runaway escalation
  cascades.
motivation: >-
  Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with rigid static routing or expensive all-or-nothing delegation, while centralized routers
  lack decentralization. Biological quorum sensing provides a robust collective signaling mechanism, but translating continuous
  ODEs to discrete LLM message turns requires explicit discrete-time recurrence, degradation damping (quorum quenching), robust
  uncertainty quantification (self-consistency entropy), analytical stability bounds on damping rates, and rigorous token-matched
  context accounting across multi-turn interactions to prevent runaway escalation cascades and isolate collective quorum benefits.
assumptions:
- >-
  Agent epistemic uncertainty can be quantified robustly via self-consistency entropy across multi-sample generation scores.
- >-
  A shared message buffer acts as an environment where autoinducers accumulate with discrete-time updates weighted by token
  length and semantic weight, subject to a constant degradation/damping rate (quorum quenching) with proven analytical stability
  bounds.
- >-
  Non-linear Hill-function activation kinetics mapped to discrete agent turns trigger dynamic model escalation (from cheap
  lightweight models to deep reasoning models) when collective concentration exceeds threshold, calibrated via hyperparameter
  sweeps.
- >-
  Cumulative token accounting accurately incorporates both agent generation tokens and shared buffer retrieval/context overhead
  across all baselines.
investigation_approach: >-
  Implement a multi-agent simulation testbed on complex reasoning benchmarks with heterogeneous LLM agents. Model autoinducer
  accumulation via discrete-time recurrence relations incorporating message token weight and degradation damping. Perform
  hyperparameter sweeps over degradation rates and Hill coefficients on a validation split, include analytical stability proofs
  for convergence, and evaluate against static routing, centralized routers, and decentralized independent threshold baselines
  with full token-matched context accounting.
success_criteria: >-
  Stabilized quorum-sensing routing achieves statistically significant Pareto efficiency gains over both static routing and
  decentralized independent threshold baselines, maintaining stable escalation rates without runaway cascades under varying
  damping coefficients and uncertainty noise.
related_works:
- >-
  RouteLLM / OmniRouter: Evaluates Bradley-Terry models or online learning for choosing between strong and weak LLMs per query,
  but relies on centralized coordination rather than decentralized collective signaling.
- >-
  Multi-agent debate / Mixture-of-Agents: Coordinates multiple LLMs via fixed rounds of discussion or layer aggregation without
  adaptive dynamic thresholding governed by collective epistemic load and degradation-damped quorum kinetics.
- >-
  Decentralized local threshold routing: Independent agent escalation based purely on local uncertainty without global quorum
  accumulation, which our approach extends and outperforms by leveraging collective density-dependent phase transitions and
  stability-bounded quorum quenching.
inspiration: >-
  Adapted from bacterial quorum sensing (LuxR/LuxI gene regulation circuits in Vibrio fischeri), enhanced with discrete-time
  recurrence, quorum quenching (degradation damping), analytical stability bounds, and information-theoretic uncertainty metrics.
terms:
- term: Quorum Sensing
  definition: >-
    A decentralized coordination mechanism where agents adjust behaviors based on collective density through signal accumulation
    in a shared environment.
- term: Autoinducer
  definition: >-
    A signaling molecule produced by agents proportional to task uncertainty and message weight that accumulates in the shared
    buffer.
- term: Quorum Quenching
  definition: >-
    A degradation and damping term in the autoinducer recurrence relation that prevents runaway positive feedback cascades.
- term: Model Escalation
  definition: >-
    Dynamically shifting a task from a cheap lightweight model to an expensive reasoning model when collective or local thresholds
    are crossed.
- term: Analytical Stability Bound
  definition: >-
    Mathematical constraints on the degradation damping coefficient guaranteeing system convergence under extreme message
    frequency without divergence.
summary: >-
  We propose stabilized quorum-sensing multi-agent reasoning using discrete-time autoinduction recurrence with degradation
  damping, self-consistency entropy, analytical convergence bounds, and rigorous context token accounting, achieving optimal
  Pareto cost-accuracy trade-offs over static and independent decentralized baselines.
</previous_hypothesis>

<previous_review_feedback>
A reviewer evaluated your previous hypothesis and provided the feedback below.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the previous hypothesis above and
REVISE it to address the feedback. Keep what works, fix what was criticized.

You MUST address ALL the critiques. Do NOT repeat the same mistakes.

kind: reviewer_feedback
id: review_hypo_20615ca744c0
overall_assessment: >-
  The revised hypothesis successfully and thoroughly addresses all previous reviewer critiques by incorporating explicit hyperparameter
  sweeps over degradation rates and Hill coefficients, and rigorously integrating token-matched context accounting across
  agent generation tokens and shared buffer retrieval/context overhead. The proposed framework (Stabilized Quorum-Sensing
  Multi-Agent Reasoning) is highly original, mathematically grounded with discrete-time recurrence and stability bounds, and
  represents a compelling decentralized alternative to centralized routers and static multi-agent systems.
strengths:
- >-
  Highly original biological analogy (LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing) adapted cleanly into discrete-time autoinduction recurrence
  with degradation damping (quorum quenching).
- >-
  Rigorously addresses previous feedback by incorporating empirical hyperparameter tuning for degradation rates and Hill coefficients.
- >-
  Comprehensive token-matched context accounting that includes both generation tokens and shared buffer retrieval overhead.
- >-
  Strong theoretical foundation featuring analytical convergence and stability bounds on damping rates.
dimension_scores:
- dimension: soundness
  score: 4
  justification: >-
    Sound technical formulation combining discrete-time recurrence, damping stability bounds, self-consistency entropy uncertainty,
    and rigorous token accounting.
  improvements:
  - >-
    Ensure analytical convergence bounds account for edge cases in extreme message frequency spikes.
- dimension: presentation
  score: 4
  justification: >-
    Exceptionally clear and well-structured conceptualization, precise definitions, and comprehensive related work framing.
  improvements:
  - >-
    Include a conceptual architecture diagram illustrating the shared buffer autoinducer accumulation and threshold escalation.
- dimension: contribution
  score: 4
  justification: >-
    Significant contribution to decentralized multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable, token-efficient Pareto trade-off
    over static and centralized routers.
  improvements:
  - Discuss potential scaling limits when agent count becomes very large.
critiques:
- id: ''
  category: rigor
  severity: minor
  description: >-
    While hyperparameter sweeps for degradation rates and Hill coefficients are planned, ensuring these sweeps cover diverse
    task difficulties (from simple math to complex code reasoning) will be critical to demonstrate robust Pareto optimality.
  suggested_action: >-
    Run validation split sweeps across at least two distinct reasoning benchmark classes to confirm stability region robustness.
score: 8
confidence: 5
relation_type: evolution
relation_rationale: >-
  Refined investigation approach with hyperparameter sweeps and token-matched context accounting.
